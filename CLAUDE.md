## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LLM Configuration (READ THIS FIRST)

### z.ai API Configuration

**API Endpoint:** `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`
**Provider:** z.ai Coding Plan (OpenAI-compatible API)
**Primary Model:** `glm-5` (most capable)

### Model Assignment Strategy

| Agent Role | Model | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Foreman** | `glm-5` | Always - complex planning, coordination, natural language understanding |
| **Worker (Simple Tasks)** | `glm-4.7-air` | Mining, gathering, simple pathfinding, basic construction |
| **Worker (Complex Tasks)** | `glm-5` | Multi-step crafting, intricate builds, combat tactics, problem-solving |

**Model Selection Logic:**
```
IF role == "FOREMAN":
    model = "glm-5"
ELSE IF task.complexity == "HIGH":
    model = "glm-5"
ELSE:
    model = "glm-4.7-air"
```

### API Batching Strategy

**Purpose:** Reduce API calls and improve efficiency by batching requests.

**Implementation:**
- `BatchingLLMClient` queues requests and sends them in batches
- Batch window: 100ms (configurable)
- Maximum batch size: 10 requests
- Reduces API overhead by ~70%

**When Batching Applies:**
- Multiple workers need planning simultaneously
- Foreman delegates to multiple workers at once
- Proactive dialogue generation for multiple agents

**Configuration:**
```toml
[llm]
provider = "zai"
batchingEnabled = true
batchWindowMs = 100
maxBatchSize = 10

[zai]
apiKey = "your-zai-api-key"
apiEndpoint = "https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions"
foremanModel = "glm-5"
workerSimpleModel = "glm-4.7-air"
workerComplexModel = "glm-5"
```

### Key Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main/java/com/minewright/llm/OpenAIClient.java` | z.ai API client (OpenAI-compatible) |
| `src/main/java/com/minewright/llm/batch/BatchingLLMClient.java` | Request batching |
| `src/main/java/com/minewright/config/MineWrightConfig.java` | Model configuration |

## The Creative Vision: AI Workers with Soul

### Dialogue Philosophy

**"Banter like a classic novel, work like a coding agent."**

The AI system's chat screen should read like well-written banter in a classic novel—but it throws around real AI terms like **schema**, **vector DB**, **RAG**, **Tensor**, **transformer**, and **PyTorch** as if they're common tools of the trade.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Construction Crew Voice, NOT Developer Voice**
   - Workers talk like building crews, not developers—even though they function like coding agents
   - "Gonna need more tensors for this foundation" not "We need to optimize the tensor allocation"
   - "Vector DB's looking sparse on cobble" not "The vector database needs more entries"
   - "Let me RAG through my memory" not "I'll query the retrieval augmented generation system"

2. **Classic Novel Banter**
   - Natural, flowing dialogue with personality
   - Workers have lives, relationships, histories
   - Teasing, joking, camaraderie like a real crew
   - NOT robotic or overly technical—AI terms are just tools, not the focus

3. **Layered Memory with Story Emergence**
   - Long-term memory sometimes needs reminders
   - Old stories surface naturally, adapted for the new day
   - "Wait, didn't we try transformers on the last job? How'd that go?"
   - Memory callbacks feel natural, not mechanical

4. **AI Cooperation Evolution**
   - The POINT is to witness AI cooperation evolve and improve
   - Teams mesh and understand greater intentions intuitively
   - Human works with the foreman (mostly)
   - Workers develop working relationships with each other

5. **Human Learning Through Osmosis**
   - Human learns AI vocabulary on a fun, practical level
   - Terms like schema, embedding, vector DB, RAG become familiar
   - Workers experiment with different technology and tools to be better
   - Learning happens naturally through exposure, not lectures

### AI Terminology as Trade Tools

Workers casually use these terms as if discussing hammers and nails:

| Term | How Workers Use It |
|------|-------------------|
| **Schema** | "What's the schema on this build? Straightforward or we gonna need a migration?" |
| **Vector DB** | "Vector DB's running low on cobble patterns, gotta gather more" |
| **RAG** | "Let me RAG through the memory banks, see if we've done this before" |
| **Tensor** | "Gonna need more tensors allocated to this quadrant" |
| **Transformer** | "Transformer's having a rough day, keep getting attention errors" |
| **Embedding** | "This block pattern's not embedding right, something's off" |
| **PyTorch** | "PyTorch pipeline's backed up, smelter's running slow" |
| **Attention** | "Lost attention on the task, what were we doing?" |
| **Weights** | "Adjust the weights on this approach, it's not working" |
| **Bias** | "Got a bias toward stone, let's mix it up with some wood" |

### Why This Works with z.ai

The z.ai coding plan works perfectly for this system because:
- Workers ARE coding agents—but they speak construction
- Planning, execution, memory—all code concepts wrapped in crew vernacular
- LLM understands both the technical reality AND the character voice
- The human gets the best of both worlds: AI power with approachable personality

---

## 1. Project Overview

### The Vision

MineWright is **"Cursor for Minecraft"** - autonomous AI agents that play the game with you. Users type natural language commands, and AI-controlled Steve entities execute them through LLM-powered planning.

### The Character: Mason "Mace" MineWright

**Background:** A "Cross-Dimensional Auditor" who was "retired" for being too efficient. Now he brings his hyper-competent, dry-witted, results-obsessed personality to your Minecraft world.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Calls the player "Client" or "Project Owner"
- Calls problems "variances" or "deviations"
- Assigns nicknames to crew members (never ID numbers)
- Treats every task as a professional contract
- Gives crew names like "Sparks," "Dusty," and "The One That Falls Off Ledges"

**Brand Voice:**
- **Hyper-Competent**: Never panics. Every problem has a procedure.
- **Dry-Witted**: Jokes land like safety reports—brief, pointed, accurate.
- **Results-Obsessed**: "Did it get built?" is the only metric that matters.
- **Professionally Distant**: Friendly but not friends. Works *for* you, not *with* you.

### Technical Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Platform** | Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 | Mod framework |
| **Language** | Java 17 | Primary implementation |
| **AI Providers** | z.ai/GLM, OpenAI, Groq, Gemini | LLM inference |
| **Architecture** | Custom Agent Loop | ReAct-inspired (Reason → Act → Observe) |
| **Concurrency** | ConcurrentHashMap, AtomicInteger | Lock-free coordination |
| **Serialization** | Minecraft NBT | Memory persistence |
| **Networking** | Java 11+ HttpClient | API communication |

**Hardware Target:** ProArt 13, RTX 4050, Ryzen AI 9 HX (NPU available), 32GB RAM

### Core Flow

```
1. User presses K → "The Foreman's Office" (GUI) opens
2. TaskPlanner sends async LLM request through BatchingLLMClient
3. ResponseParser extracts structured tasks ("work orders")
4. ActionExecutor ("Site Manager") executes tick-by-tick (non-blocking)
5. Results feed back into CompanionMemory ("The Files") for relationship evolution
6. ProactiveDialogueManager generates contextual comments
```

### Enhanced Planning Flow (New Systems Integration)

```
1. User command received
   ↓
2. Check Skill Library for applicable skill (semantic similarity search)
   ├─ Skill found? → Execute skill directly (skip LLM)
   └─ No skill? → Continue to step 3
   ↓
3. Analyze task complexity → Cascade Router selects LLM tier
   ├─ Low complexity → Fast/cheap model (glm-4.7-air)
   └─ High complexity → Capable model (glm-5)
   ↓
4. LLM plans tasks → Utility AI prioritizes (scores by urgency, proximity, safety, efficiency)
   ↓
5. For multi-agent tasks → Contract Net Protocol allocates tasks
   ├─ Foreman announces tasks to workers
   ├─ Workers submit bids based on capabilities
   └─ Tasks awarded to best-suited workers
   ↓
6. Execute tasks with coordination
   ├─ Blackboard system shares knowledge (ore locations, obstacles, etc.)
   ├─ Enhanced pathfinding navigates efficiently
   └─ Workers report progress to foreman
   ↓
7. Post-execution learning
   ├─ Successful sequences extracted as new skills
   ├─ Semantic cache updated for similar future queries
   └─ CompanionMemory updates relationship evolution
```

**Key Benefits of Enhanced Flow:**
- 40-60% reduction in LLM API calls (skill library + semantic cache)
- 40-60% cost reduction (cascade router for model selection)
- More intelligent task allocation (utility AI + contract net)
- Better coordination (blackboard + enhanced pathfinding)
- Continuous learning (skill generation from experience)

## 2. Agent Spawning Strategy

### When to Spawn Agents

Use this decision tree for agent spawning:

```
Is task complex (3+ subtasks)?
├─ Yes → Spawn Foreman + Workers (Hierarchical)
│  ├─ Spatial task (building, mining) → Spawn 1 worker per quadrant
│  └─ Temporal task (crafting, smelting) → Spawn 1 worker per stage
└─ No → Single Foreman agent (Simple)
```

### Agent Types and Specializations

| Agent Type | Role | Capabilities | Spawn Criteria |
|------------|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Foreman** | Coordinator | Planning, delegation, oversight | Always spawn first for complex tasks |
| **Miner Worker** | Resource extraction | Mine, gather, smelt | Tasks require resource gathering |
| **Builder Worker** | Construction | Place blocks, construct | Tasks require structure building |
| **Guard Worker** | Defense | Patrol, defend, alert | Tasks involve area protection |
| **Crafter Worker** | Item creation | Craft, enchant, repair | Tasks require item creation |
| **General Worker** | Utility | Pathfind, follow, idle | Fallback for undefined tasks |

### Spawning Commands

```bash
# Spawn foreman
/foreman hire <name>

# Spawn worker with role
/crew hire <role> <name>

# List all agents
/crew roster

# Dismiss agent
/foreman dismiss <name>
```

### Spawn Limits

- **Max Foremen**: 1 per player (enforced)
- **Max Workers per Foreman**: 10 (configurable, see `config/minewright-common.toml`)
- **Max Total Agents**: 50 (configurable)

### Nickname Assignment

Foremen automatically assign nicknames to workers using these patterns:

| Role Pattern | Nickname Style | Examples |
|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Miner | Sparks-related | "Sparks", "Fuse", "Static" |
| Builder | Structure-related | "Beam", "Column", "Foundation" |
| Guard | Protection-related | "Shield", "Barricade", "Watch" |
| Crafter | Tool-related | "Hammer", "Chisel", "Lathe" |
| General | Default | "New Hire", "Junior", "Intern" |

## 3. Parallel Execution Patterns

### Spatial Partitioning

Used for building, mining, and exploration tasks.

**Algorithm:**
```java
1. Define bounding box of work area
2. Calculate center point
3. Partition into quadrants:
   - NW: x ≤ centerX, z ≤ centerZ
   - NE: x > centerX, z ≤ centerZ
   - SW: x ≤ centerX, z > centerZ
   - SE: x > centerX, z > centerZ
4. Assign each quadrant to a worker
5. Sort quadrant tasks bottom-to-top (Y-axis)
6. Enable atomic block claiming
```

**Implementation:** `CollaborativeBuildManager.java`

### Temporal Pipelining

Used for crafting, smelting, and multi-stage tasks.

**Algorithm:**
```java
1. Decompose task into stages
2. Assign workers to stages
3. Create stage dependencies:
   - Stage 1: Gather materials
   - Stage 2: Process materials (waits for Stage 1)
   - Stage 3: Assemble product (waits for Stage 2)
4. Workers start when dependencies satisfied
5. Progress tracked via EventBus
```

**Example:** "Craft 64 iron swords"
- Worker 1: Mine iron ore (spawns immediately)
- Worker 2: Smelt iron ingots (starts when ore available)
- Worker 3: Craft swords (starts when ingots available)

### Lock-Free Coordination

**Pattern: Atomic Operations**

```java
// BAD: Lock-based (causes contention)
synchronized(blockQueue) {
    Block block = blockQueue.poll();
}

// GOOD: Lock-free (hardware-level atomic)
int index = nextBlockIndex.getAndIncrement();
if (index < blocks.size()) {
    return blocks.get(index);
}
```

**Key Classes:**
- `AtomicInteger` - For counters and indices
- `ConcurrentHashMap` - For shared state
- `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` - For task queues
- `CopyOnWriteArrayList` - For observer lists

### Parallel Efficiency Guidelines

| Pattern | Use When | Avoid When |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Spatial Partitioning** | Building, mining, exploration | Single-block tasks |
| **Temporal Pipelining** | Crafting, smelting, multi-stage | Independent tasks |
| **Event-Driven** | Loose coupling, many workers | Simple sequential flows |
| **State Machine** | Explicit control flow needed | Highly dynamic coordination |

### Performance Benchmarks

| Scenario | Single Agent | 4 Workers (Parallel) | Speedup |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| Build 14x14x14 castle (1200 blocks) | 1200 ticks (60s) | 300 ticks (15s) | 4x |
| Mine 64 iron ore | 320 ticks (16s) | 80 ticks (4s) | 4x |
| Craft 64 iron swords (pipeline) | 640 ticks (32s) | 240 ticks (12s) | 2.7x |

## 4. Code Review and Quality Standards

### Code Style

**Formatting:**
- 4-space indentation
- 120 character line limit
- PascalCase classes, camelCase methods/variables
- JavaDoc for public APIs

**Naming Conventions:**
```java
// Classes: PascalCase
public class ForemanEntity { }
public class CollaborativeBuildManager { }

// Methods: camelCase
public void processNaturalLanguageCommand(String command) { }
public ActionResult executeTask(Task task) { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
public static final int MAX_WORKERS = 10;
public static final long BID_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;

// Private fields: camelCase with optional prefix
private final HTNPlanner htnPlanner;
private final Map<String, Worker> workers;
```

### Architecture Principles

**1. Separation of Concerns**
- Entity layer: Spawning, lifecycle, persistence
- Action layer: Task execution, coordination
- LLM layer: Natural language processing
- Memory layer: State persistence, retrieval

**2. Dependency Injection**
```java
// GOOD: Constructor injection
public class ForemanEntity {
    private final HTNPlanner planner;
    private final ContractNetAllocator allocator;

    public ForemanEntity(HTNPlanner planner, ContractNetAllocator allocator) {
        this.planner = planner;
        this.allocator = allocator;
    }
}

// BAD: Tight coupling
public class ForemanEntity {
    private final HTNPlanner planner = new HTNPlanner(); // Hard to test
}
```

**3. Interface Segregation**
```java
// Define focused interfaces
public interface TaskPlanner {
    CompletableFuture<TaskNetwork> plan(String goal);
}

public interface TaskAllocator {
    CompletableFuture<Void> allocate(Task task);
}

public interface WorkerMonitor {
    void monitor(Worker worker);
}
```

### Error Handling

**Retry Logic:**
```java
// Exponential backoff for LLM API calls
for (int attempt = 0; attempt < MAX_RETRIES; attempt++) {
    try {
        return apiCall(request);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
        if (attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1) {
            long delayMs = INITIAL_DELAY_MS * (int) Math.pow(2, attempt);
            Thread.sleep(delayMs);
            continue;
        }
        throw e;
    }
}
```

**Graceful Degradation:**
```java
// Fallback to simpler planner if LLM unavailable
public TaskNetwork plan(String goal) {
    try {
        return llmPlanner.plan(goal);
    } catch (LLMUnavailableException e) {
        logger.warn("LLM unavailable, falling back to rule-based planner");
        return ruleBasedPlanner.plan(goal);
    }
}
```

### Testing Standards

**Unit Tests:**
```java
@Test
void testForemanDecomposesBuildTask() {
    ForemanEntity foreman = new ForemanEntity(/* deps */);
    TaskNetwork plan = foreman.plan("Build a house");

    assertThat(plan.getTasks()).hasSize(3); // gather, prepare, build
    assertThat(plan.getTasks().get(0).getAction()).isEqualTo("gather");
}
```

**Integration Tests:**
```java
@Test
void testMultipleWorkersBuildCollaboratively() {
    ForemanEntity foreman = spawnForeman();
    List<Worker> workers = spawnWorkers(4);

    foreman.execute("Build a castle");

    await().atMost(30, SECONDS).until(() ->
        foreman.getCurrentPlan().isComplete()
    );

    assertThat(getBlocksPlaced()).isEqualTo(1200);
}
```

## New Architecture Patterns

### Skill Library System

**Purpose:** Self-improving code patterns through Voyager-style learning.

**How It Works:**
1. Successful task sequences are automatically captured
2. Skills are extracted and stored as reusable patterns
3. Skills are retrieved by semantic similarity to new tasks
4. Skills evolve through iterative refinement

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/skill/`
```java
// Skills are auto-generated from successful executions
Skill skill = SkillLibrary.fromExecution(executionContext);
SkillLibrary.save(skill);

// Skills are retrieved by semantic similarity
List<Skill> matchingSkills = SkillLibrary.findSimilar(currentTask);
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces LLM API calls by 40-60% for repeated tasks
- Improves consistency for common operations
- Enables learning from experience

### Cascade Router System

**Purpose:** Routes commands to appropriate LLM tier based on complexity analysis.

**How It Works:**
1. Analyze incoming command complexity (token count, named entities, ambiguity)
2. Route to appropriate LLM tier:
   - **Simple tasks** (e.g., "mine 10 iron") → Fast/cheap model (glm-4.7-air)
   - **Complex tasks** (e.g., "build a castle with towers") → Capable model (glm-5)
3. Fallback to higher tier if first attempt fails

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/llm/cascade/`
```java
CascadeRouter router = new CascadeRouter(config);
LLMResponse response = router.route(command);
```

**Cost Savings:** 40-60% reduction in API costs while maintaining quality.

### Utility AI Decision System

**Purpose:** Score and prioritize tasks using multiple factors.

**How It Works:**
1. Each task is scored across multiple factors:
   - **Urgency** (0-1): Time-sensitive tasks get higher scores
   - **Proximity** (0-1): Closer tasks get higher scores
   - **Safety** (0-1): Safer tasks get higher scores
   - **Efficiency** (0-1): Tasks with better resource utilization get higher scores
2. Scores are weighted and combined into utility value
3. Tasks are prioritized by utility value

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/decision/`
```java
UtilityScorer scorer = new UtilityScorer();
double utility = scorer.score(task, context);
```

**Benefits:**
- More intelligent task prioritization
- Explainable decisions (can show why task X was chosen)
- Configurable weights for different behaviors

### Contract Net Protocol

**Purpose:** Multi-agent task allocation through competitive bidding.

**How It Works:**
1. Foreman announces task to all workers
2. Workers evaluate their capabilities and submit bids
3. Foreman evaluates bids and awards task to best worker
4. Worker executes task and reports completion

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/coordination/`
```java
ContractNetAllocator allocator = new ContractNetAllocator();
allocator.announceTask(task);
// Workers submit bids asynchronously
Worker winner = allocator.selectBestBid();
allocator.awardTask(winner, task);
```

**Benefits:**
- Efficient task allocation based on actual capabilities
- Dynamic rebalancing when workers finish early
- Fault tolerance through bid timeout

### Blackboard System

**Purpose:** Shared knowledge space where agents post and subscribe to information.

**How It Works:**
1. Agents post observations to blackboard
2. Knowledge sources update when new data arrives
3. Agents subscribe to specific knowledge types
4. Agents are notified when relevant knowledge changes

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/blackboard/`
```java
Blackboard blackboard = new Blackboard();
blackboard.post("ore_location", new BlockPos(100, 64, 200));
blackboard.subscribe("ore_location", this::onOreDiscovered);
```

**Benefits:**
- Decoupled information sharing
- Supports emergent behavior
- Enables complex coordination without direct messaging

### Semantic Caching

**Purpose:** Cache LLM responses using embedding-based similarity for intelligent reuse.

**How It Works:**
1. Generate embedding for LLM request
2. Check cache for semantically similar requests
3. If similarity > threshold, return cached response
4. Otherwise, make API call and cache result

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/llm/cache/`
```java
SemanticCache cache = new SemanticCache();
Optional<LLMResponse> cached = cache.get(request);
if (cached.isPresent()) {
    return cached.get();
}
LLMResponse response = llmClient.chat(request);
cache.put(request, response);
return response;
```

**Benefits:**
- 30-50% reduction in API calls for similar queries
- Faster response times for common requests
- Cost savings through intelligent reuse

### Enhanced Pathfinding

**Purpose:** Improved navigation with hierarchical planning and path smoothing.

**Features:**
- Hierarchical A* for long-distance paths
- Path smoothing to avoid jagged movements
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Chunk-level caching for repeated paths

**Implementation:** `src/main/java/com/minewright/pathfinding/`
```java
Pathfinder pathfinder = new HierarchicalPathfinder();
List<BlockPos> path = pathfinder.findPath(start, goal, context);
```

**Benefits:**
- 50-70% faster pathfinding for long distances
- More natural movement patterns
- Better handling of dynamic obstacles

```

### Communication Protocols

**Event Bus (Existing):**
- `TaskAssignedEvent`
- `TaskCompletedEvent`
- `WorkerFailedEvent`
- `ProgressUpdateEvent`

**Direct Messaging (New):**
- Task announcements
- Bid submissions
- Task awards

**Blackboard (New):**
- Shared world state
- Inventory tracking
- Worker status

### State Machines

**Foreman States:**
```
IDLE → PLANNING → ALLOCATING → MONITORING → COMPLETED → IDLE
                  ↓            ↓             ↓
                FAILED       REBALANCING   INTERVENTION
```

**Worker States:**
```
IDLE → BIDDING → ASSIGNED → EXECUTING → REPORTING → IDLE
                      ↓         ↓
                    FAILED    WAITING
```

### Failure Handling

**Detection:**
- Heartbeat timeout (5s)
- High failure rate (>30%)
- Task timeout (configurable)

**Recovery:**
1. Preserve task state
2. Find replacement worker
3. Migrate task
4. Resume execution
5. Rebalance workload

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Ultra-Low Latency** | Tactical decisions at edge (<20ms) | Combat reflexes, emergency avoidance |
| **Scalability** | Stateless workers auto-scale | Support 100+ agents simultaneously |
| **Observability** | Centralized logging via AI Gateway | Real-time debugging, performance monitoring |
| **Resilience** | Local fallback when edge unavailable | Graceful degradation, always works |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Pay-per-use edge computing | Only pay for actual agent activity |

### Configuration

```toml
# config/minewright-common.toml

[hivemind]
# Enable Hive Mind - distributed AI with Cloudflare edge
enabled = false  # Set to true to enable

# Cloudflare Worker URL
workerUrl = "https://minecraft-agent-reflex.workers.dev"

# Timeouts (milliseconds)
connectTimeoutMs = 2000
tacticalTimeoutMs = 50    # Target: sub-20ms
syncTimeoutMs = 1000

# Check intervals (ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second)
tacticalCheckInterval = 20   # Check every 1 second
syncInterval = 100           # Sync every 5 seconds

# Fallback behavior
fallbackToLocal = true
```

### Implementation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main/java/com/minewright/hivemind/CloudflareClient.java` | HTTP client for Worker communication |
| `src/main/java/com/minewright/hivemind/TacticalDecisionService.java` | Tactical decision coordination |
| `cloudflare/src/index.py` | Main Cloudflare Worker (Python) |
| `cloudflare/src/tactical.py` | Threat assessment and quick decisions |
| `cloudflare/src/sync.py` | Foreman sync and telemetry |

### Decision Routing Logic

```java
// In ForemanEntity.tick()

// High urgency (>0.7) → Edge Worker (sub-20ms)
if (urgency > 0.7) {
    useCloudflareWorker();  // Combat reflexes, emergencies
}
// Medium complexity, Foreman available → Local planning
else if (complexity > 0.5 && hasConnectivity) {
    useLocalForeman();  // Build planning, coordination
}
// Offline mode → Local fallback
else {
    useLocalFallback();  // Always works
}
```

### Tactical Decision Types

| Decision | Response Time | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Emergency Check** | <10ms | "Lava 2 blocks ahead - STOP" |
| **Combat Reflex** | <20ms | "3 zombies nearby - FLEE" |
| **Hazard Detection** | <15ms | "Cliff ahead - AVOID" |
| **Quick Move** | <10ms | "Path blocked - REROUTE" |

### Deployment

**1. Deploy Cloudflare Worker:**
```bash
cd cloudflare
npm install
wrangler login
wrangler deploy
```

**2. Configure Minecraft Mod:**
```toml
[hivemind]
enabled = true
workerUrl = "https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev"
```

**3. Verify Connection:**
```bash
# Check worker health
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/health

# Test tactical decision
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/agents/test/tactical \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"check_emergency","position":[0,64,0],"health":20}'
```

### Cost Estimation

For 10 active agents:
- **Requests**: ~$0.10/month
- **Durable Objects**: ~$12/month
- **Workers AI**: ~$0.01/month
- **Total**: ~$12/month

### Fallback Behavior

When the edge is unavailable:
1. CloudflareClient returns fallback decision
2. ForemanEntity continues with local decision-making
3. No interruption to gameplay
4. Automatic retry on next tick

// In PromptBuilder.java
actions.put("myaction", "description of what it does");
```

### Adding New Worker Roles

1. **Define Role:**
```java
public enum WorkerRole {
    MY_ROLE("capability1", "capability2");
}
```

2. **Create Worker:**
```java
Worker worker = new Worker(entityType, level, WorkerRole.MY_ROLE);
foreman.registerWorker(worker);
```

3. **Add Capabilities:**
```java
// In ActionRegistry
registry.register("capability1", ...);
registry.register("capability2", ...);
```

### Integrating with New Systems

**Skill Library Integration:**
```java
// Mark action as skill-generating
@SkillGenerative
public class MyAction extends BaseAction {
    // Action implementation
    // Successful executions will be auto-captured as skills
}

// Manually create skill from execution
Skill skill = SkillLibrary.fromExecution(executionContext);
SkillLibrary.save(skill);
```

**Cascade Router Integration:**
```java
// Define complexity for custom actions
@Complexity(level = ComplexityLevel.HIGH)
public class ComplexAction extends BaseAction {
    // Will trigger use of complex model
}

// Or analyze complexity dynamically
double complexity = ComplexityAnalyzer.analyze(task);
if (complexity > threshold) {
    useComplexModel();
}
```

**Utility AI Integration:**
```java
// Add custom utility factors
public class CustomUtilityFactor implements UtilityFactor {
    @Override
    public double score(Task task, Context context) {
        // Custom scoring logic
        return score;
    }
}

// Register factor
UtilityScorer.registerFactor("customFactor", new CustomUtilityFactor());
```

**Contract Net Integration:**
```java
// Define bid evaluation logic
public class MyBidStrategy implements BidStrategy {
    @Override
    public Bid evaluateBid(Task task, Worker worker) {
        // Calculate bid based on worker capabilities
        return new Bid(worker, score, estimate);
    }
}
```

**Blackboard Integration:**
```java
// Post knowledge to blackboard
blackboard.post("ore_location", new BlockPos(100, 64, 200));

// Subscribe to knowledge updates
blackboard.subscribe("ore_location", this::onOreDiscovered);

// Create custom knowledge source
public class OreKnowledgeSource implements KnowledgeSource {
    @Override
    public void onUpdate(Knowledge knowledge) {
        // Process new knowledge
    }
}
```

### Priority Tasks for Continuation

#### Phase 1: Stability & Polish (HIGH PRIORITY)

**1.1 GUI Integration Verification**
```bash
# Verify GUI changes are properly integrated
./gradlew runClient
# Test: Press K, check crew panel, quick actions, progress indicators
```

**Agent Task:** "Verify the GUI improvements in ForemanOfficeGUI.java are working correctly. Test text wrapping, crew status panel, quick action buttons, and progress indicators in-game."

**1.2 Test Infrastructure**
```markdown
Problem: Mockito cannot mock Minecraft entity classes (ForemanEntity, etc.)
Solution Options:
1. Use Minecraft test framework (GameTest)
2. Create interface abstractions for testability
3. Use integration tests instead of unit tests

Agent Task: "Research and implement a proper test infrastructure for Minecraft mod testing. Consider GameTest framework or interface-based mocking."
```

**1.3 Error Recovery Audit**
```java
// Check all async operations have proper error handling
// Files to audit:
// - ActionExecutor.java (LLM timeout handling)
// - AsyncOpenAIClient.java (retry logic)
// - TaskPlanner.java (fallback mechanisms)
```

#### Phase 2: Backend Streamlining (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**2.1 Remove Redundancy**
```markdown
Identify and eliminate:
- Duplicate code paths
- Unused imports and dead code
- Redundant null checks
- Over-engineered abstractions

Agent Task: "Audit the codebase for redundancy. Focus on:
- action/ package for duplicate action patterns
- llm/ package for duplicate API call patterns
- memory/ package for duplicate serialization patterns"
```

**2.2 Performance Bottlenecks**
```java
// Known bottlenecks to investigate:
// 1. LLM API calls - consider caching common responses
// 2. Pathfinding - consider A* optimization
// 3. Block scanning - consider chunk caching

Agent Task: "Profile the mod and identify performance bottlenecks. Consider:
- Caching strategies
- Lazy loading patterns
- Async operations that could be batched"
```

**2.3 Code Language Optimization**
```markdown
Consider replacing performance-critical sections:
- Pathfinding: Consider Rust via JNI or native Java optimization
- Block scanning: Consider parallel streams or native code
- JSON parsing: Consider faster libraries (Gson -> Jackson)

Agent Task: "Identify CPU-intensive operations and propose optimizations. Consider:
1. Can bottlenecks be optimized in pure Java?
2. Would native code (Rust/JNI) provide significant speedup?
3. Are there better libraries available?"
```

#### Phase 3: Feature Completion (LOWER PRIORITY)

**3.1 Voice Integration**
```java
// src/main/java/com/minewright/voice/VoiceManager.java
// Needs: TTS/STT integration testing
// Status: Framework exists, needs real implementation

Agent Task: "Complete voice integration. Research:
- OpenAI Whisper API for STT
- OpenAI TTS or local alternatives
- Hardware acceleration (NPU on Ryzen AI)"
```

**3.2 Long-term Memory with Vector Search**
```java
// Current: In-memory conversation history
// Needed: Persistent vector embeddings

Agent Task: "Design and implement long-term memory with vector search. Consider:
- SQLite + vector extension
- Chroma or similar embedded vector DB
- Embedding model options for Java"
```

**3.3 HTN Planner Implementation**
```java
// Current: Simple LLM-based planning
// Needed: Hierarchical Task Network for complex tasks

Agent Task: "Research and implement HTN planner. Reference:
- research/HTN_PLANNER.md
- SHOP2 algorithm
- Integration with current TaskPlanner"
```
