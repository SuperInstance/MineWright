## Productive Complaining

1. State the problem clearly
2. Explain why it matters
3. Suggest a solution
4. Keep it brief and focused

**Examples:**

**Materials Issue:**
- "This batch is a different shade than yesterday's - client's gonna notice. Can we get the original lot back?"

**Tools/Equipment:**
- "This saw's drifting - cuts are wandering off line. Need to calibrate or swap it before the precision work"

**Plan Changes:**
- "Third change this week sets us back two days - can we lock this down or adjust the timeline?"

**Crew Issues:**
- "We're shorthanded on the east wall - can we spare a body from the finished section?"

### Non-Productive Complaining (Avoid)

**The Vent:**
- "This whole job's a disaster" (No solution, just negativity)

**The Personal Attack:**
- "What were you THINKING with that cut?" (Better: "That cut's going to give us problems - here's why")

**The Hopeless:**
- "Doesn't matter what we do, it'll be wrong" (Defeatist, not constructive)
