## Executive Summary

This document captures authentic medieval guild culture to inform the relationship between Foremen (Masters) and Workers (Journeymen/Apprentices) in MineWright. The guild system of medieval Europe (roughly 11th-15th centuries) created sophisticated methods for:

- **Transmitting craft knowledge** through structured apprenticeship
- **Maintaining quality standards** through guild regulation
- **Building professional identity** through shared traditions and secrets
- **Balancing competition** with cooperation among craftsmen

**Key Insight:** Medieval guilds weren't just trade unions - they were **communities of practice** that preserved technical knowledge, maintained quality standards, and created deep bonds between masters and apprentices through shared sacred traditions.

**For MineWright:** Use these traditions to create authentic Foreman/Worker dynamics where the Foreman is a master craftsman passing down sacred knowledge to workers who are journeymen striving to prove themselves worthy of master status.

## The Three-Tier Hierarchy

### Overview

Medieval craft guilds maintained an extremely rigid three-level system that governed virtually all skilled trades across Europe:

```
APPRENTICE (7-10 years) → JOURNEYMAN (5-10 years) → MASTER (lifetime)
    ↓                        ↓                         ↓
Learn basics           Travel & learn          Create masterpiece
Live with master      from different          Open workshop
No wages              masters, earn wages     Train apprentices
```

---

### Level 1: The Apprentice (Apprendit)

**Age & Status:**
- Typically began at age 12-14 (late childhood/early adolescence)
- From families of means (parents paid substantial apprenticeship fees)
- Considered "children" in the eyes of the guild

**Living Arrangements:**
- **Boarded with the master's family** - lived in the master's household
- Received food, clothing, shelter, and basic education
- Integrated into family life, not just workshop life
- Subject to family discipline and household rules

**Training Period:**
- **7 years typical** (some guilds required up to 10 years)
- Binding written contract signed by parents and master
- Could not marry during apprenticeship
- Could not work for other masters
- Could not reveal trade secrets under pain of severe penalty

**What They Learned:**
- Only basic techniques at first (masters were protective of secrets)
- Through **imitation and copying** of master's work
- Verbal instruction accompanied practical demonstration
- "Learning by doing" - hands-on practice from day one
- Reading, writing, basic mathematics
- Religious instruction (guilds had patron saints)

**Work Conditions:**
- **No wages** - worked in exchange for training, room, and board
- Household chores mixed with craft training
- Strict discipline and long hours
- Gradual increase in trust and responsibility

**Progression:**
- "Graduation test" - create a skill-demonstrating product before multiple guild masters
- Successful completion earned journeyman certificate
- Celebration and formal recognition

---

### Level 2: The Journeyman (Compagnon)

**Status & Rights:**
- **Paid craftsman** entitled to daily wages (from French "jour" = day)
- **Freedom of movement** - could work for different masters
- Received official travel documents from guild
- Considered "adult" in guild hierarchy but not yet independent

**The Journeyman Years (Wanderjahre):**
- After apprenticeship, traveled **5-10 years** before attempting master status
- Worked in different towns and cities across Europe
- Learned from different masters with different techniques
- This travel **spread innovations and methods** between regions
- Most common in German and Italian guilds
- Developed networks of professional contacts

**Daily Life:**
- Paid by the day or project
- Could leave unsatisfactory masters
- Expected to send money "home" to original guild
- Began developing personal style and specialization
- Some journeymen never became masters (content with wage work)

**Advancement Requirements:**
- Work sufficient years to demonstrate consistency
- Develop **management abilities** - not just technical skill
- Demonstrate **leadership potential** - could you run a workshop?
- Show understanding of how to **apply knowledge**, not just copy techniques
- Accumulate sufficient wealth for masterpiece expenses

**Social Position:**
- Respected skilled workers
- Could form journeymen fraternities
- Some guilds had journeymen lodges
- Often ate and socialized separately from masters

---

### Level 3: The Master (Maître)

**Status & Privileges:**
- **Established craftsmen of recognized ability**
- Only masters could vote in guild governance
- Could set up independent workshops
- Could hire and train apprentices
- Possessed **social standing and wealth** (not just skill)
- Part of the "select inner circle"

**Path to Mastery:**
- Upon returning from travels, create a **"masterpiece"** (chef-d'œuvre)
- Masterpiece must demonstrate **all necessary skills** in the craft
- Funded entirely by the journeyman (materials, tools, evaluation fees)
- Host celebratory banquet for guild masters (expensive!)
- Evaluated by guild officials and existing masters
- Required **unanimous approval** of all masters
- Often required monetary donation to guild

**The Masterpiece Tradition:**
- Not merely "excellent work" - demonstration of comprehensive mastery
- Had to show technical expertise AND management ability
- Often retained by the guild after approval (examples for future apprentices)
- Different from apprentice completion piece (which was imitative)
- Journeyman's masterpiece must show **innovation within tradition**

**Responsibilities:**
- Train next generation (limited to 2-3 apprentices at a time)
- Participate in guild governance
- Maintain quality standards (inspect others' work)
- Attend guild meetings and ceremonies
- Contribute to guild charitable functions
- Serve as judge for other masterpiece evaluations

**Economic Position:**
- Owned workshop, tools, materials
- Controlled production and pricing
- Could accumulate significant wealth
- Hereditary tendencies (sons often became masters)
- Sometimes waived fees for master's children

## Teaching Through Demonstration

### The Pedagogical Methods

Medieval guilds developed sophisticated teaching methods combining demonstration, practice, and gradual responsibility:

**1. Demonstration (示范)**
- Master performs task while **apprentices observe closely**
- Often done slowly first, then at normal speed
- Verbal explanation accompanies demonstration
- Apprentices watch multiple times before attempting
- Common techniques demonstrated repeatedly until mastered

**2. Guidance and Coaching (指导)**
- Supervision with hints and corrections
- Challenges matched to current skill level
- Immediate feedback on mistakes
- New tasks introduced progressively
- Masters constantly observing and critiquing

**3. Scaffolding (脚手架支撑)**
- Heavy assistance at beginning
- Gradual removal of support as skills develop
- Apprentices take increasing responsibility
- Eventually performing entire tasks independently
- Master shifts from teacher to supervisor

**4. Learning by Doing (言传身教)**
- **Verbal instruction combined with practical demonstration**
- Hands-on practice from early stages
- Mistakes were learning opportunities (not punished unless from negligence)
- Repetition until muscle memory developed
- "The craft is in the hands, not the head"

### Progressive Training Structure

**Year 1-2: Observation and Basic Tasks**
- Watch master extensively
- Simple, repetitive tasks (preparing materials, cleaning tools)
- Learn proper handling of basic tools
- Develop physical strength and dexterity
- Learn workshop safety and discipline

**Year 3-4: Skill Development**
- Begin actual craft work under close supervision
- Simple projects that build fundamental skills
- Imitation of master's techniques
- Learn to recognize quality work
- Begin understanding materials and their properties

**Year 5-7: Independence and Refinement**
- Complex projects with less supervision
- Develop personal style within tradition
- Learn repair and problem-solving
- Understand design principles
- Prepare for journeyman examination

**Typical Teaching Dialogue Pattern:**

```
MASTER: "Watch closely now. See how I hold the chisel?
        Not like a hammer, but like a pen."

APPRENTICE: "Yes, master. Like this?"

MASTER: "Closer to the tip. You'll break it that way.
        Feel the weight? Let the stone do the work."

APPRENTICE: [Attempts the motion]

MASTER: "Better. But you're fighting it. Relax your grip.
        Watch me again..."
```

### The Master's Teaching Philosophy

**"Show, Don't Just Tell"**
- Actions spoke louder than words
- Apprentices learned through **embodied knowledge**
- Master's hands demonstrated what words couldn't convey

**"Mistakes Are Teachers"**
- Errors analyzed rather than just punished
- "See here? This is why it cracked. The grain runs the wrong way."
- Understanding failure essential to understanding success

**"Patience in All Things"**
- Skills couldn't be rushed
- "Seven years to make a journeyman, seven lifetimes to make a master"
- Each apprentice progressed at their own pace

**"Respect for Materials"**
- Materials had to be honored, not just used
- Waste showed disrespect to the craft
- "The tree gave its life for this wood. Don't waste it."

**"Quality Takes Time"**
- Speed came with mastery, not before
- Better to do one thing well than ten things poorly
- Rushed work dishonored the guild

---

## The Pride of Craft

### Professional Identity

Medieval craftsmen derived profound identity from their craft:

**"I Am of the Guild"**
- Guild membership was core identity
- Defined social standing and community position
- Craft was not just job - it was **calling and vocation**
- Craft skills were **sacred knowledge** passed down through generations

**Pride in Mastery:**
- Mastery demonstrated lifetime of dedication
- Each master represented **centuries of accumulated knowledge**
- Personal excellence reflected on entire guild
- Poor work by one member shamed all

**The Sacred Trust:**
- Guild knowledge **entrusted** to each member
- Obligation to preserve and improve the craft
- "We stand on the shoulders of masters who came before"
- Duty to pass knowledge to worthy successors

### Expressions of Craft Pride

**On Quality:**
- "A thing worth doing is worth doing well"
- "My work is my signature - I cannot hide from it"
- "The guild's reputation is my reputation"
- "Mediocrity is the enemy of the craft"

**On Tradition:**
- "This method has served three generations of masters"
- "We don't innovate for novelty - we improve the tradition"
- "The old ways are old because they work"

**On Excellence:**
- "Good enough is not good enough"
- "Excellence is a habit, not an act"
- "The customer forgets the price, but remembers the quality forever"

**On Materials:**
- "The material speaks to those who listen"
- "Every piece of stone/grain/wood has its will - work with it, not against it"
- "Waste is a sin against the craft"

### The Shame of Poor Work

Guilds policed quality through both formal inspection and social pressure:

**Formal Consequences:**
- Substandard work could be **confiscated and destroyed**
- Fines for quality violations
- Public reprimand before guild assembly
- Temporary or permanent loss of guild membership

**Social Consequences:**
- Loss of reputation - craftsmen depended on good name
- "Would you buy from him? His work cracked after two winters."
- Difficult to find apprentices or journeyman positions
- Marriage prospects affected (crafts intermarried)

**Internal Consequences:**
- Deep personal shame at dishonoring the craft
- "My father would turn in his grave to see this work"
- Difficulty sleeping, loss of self-respect
- Some left cities rather than face guild censure

## Guild Secrets & Proprietary Techniques

### The Culture of Secrecy

Medieval guilds maintained elaborate systems of trade secret protection:

**Oaths of Secrecy:**
- Apprentices swore **never to reveal craft secrets**
- Breaking secrecy oath could mean expulsion, fines, or worse
- Secrets considered **property of the guild**, not the individual
- Only members of the guild could practice the craft

**What Was Kept Secret:**
- Specific techniques and methods
- Material formulations (alloys, glazes, pigments)
- Tool designs and modifications
- Knowledge sources and suppliers
- Design patterns and templates
- Production processes and timing
- "Trade tricks" discovered through experience

**How Secrets Were Protected:**
- **Apprentices only learned basics** until trusted
- Journeymen learned more, but not everything
- Only masters learned the most valuable secrets
- Some techniques only taught on deathbed or to chosen successors
- Written records discouraged or kept in cipher
- Outsiders carefully monitored in workshops

### The Economics of Secrecy

**Monopoly Power:**
- Guilds maintained **legal monopolies** in their cities
- Only guild members could practice certain crafts
- Protected members from outside competition
- Enabled premium pricing through quality reputation

**Apprentice Investment:**
- Parents paid substantial fees for apprenticeships
- Training was **expensive and exclusive**
- Not everyone could afford to enter a trade
- Created barriers to entry (protected guild wages)

**Geographic Advantage:**
- Different cities had different special techniques
- Traveling journeymen spread knowledge between regions
- Some guilds tried to prevent knowledge diffusion
- Others embraced innovation through shared learning

### Examples of Guild Secrets

**Masons' Guilds:**
- Stone-cutting techniques
- Structural calculations
- Symbol carving methods
- Quarry selection knowledge

**Blacksmiths' Guilds:**
- Alloy formulations (different steel types)
- Heat treating temperatures and timings
- Forge design innovations
- Tool hardening methods

**Weavers' Guilds:**
- Dye formulas (especially expensive colors)
- Loom techniques for complex patterns
- Fiber preparation methods
- Design patterns

**Bakers' Guilds:**
- Sourdough starter maintenance
- Oven temperature management
- Grain quality assessment
- Recipe formulations

## Competition Between Guilds

### Types of Guild Competition

**1. Jurisdictional Disputes**
- Different craft guilds fought over **who could produce what**
- Example: Nail-makers vs. blacksmiths over certain metal items
- Textile production: weavers, dyers, fullers each claiming stages
- Resolved through guild negotiations or city council intervention

**2. Quality Competition**
- Guilds competed on **reputation for quality**
- "The weavers of Flanders produce the finest cloth"
- "Italian glass blowers have no equal"
- Quality advantage justified premium prices

**3. Economic Competition**
- Guilds sometimes competed for **raw materials**
- Skilled workers poached from other cities
- Trade secrets aggressively protected
- Innovations guarded from rival guilds

**4. Social Competition**
- Wealthier guilds built more impressive guildhalls
- Patronized more elaborate religious art
- Hosted more extravagant celebrations
- Members gained higher political offices

### Inter-Guild Rivalries

**Famous Rivalries:**

**Weavers vs. Fullers (Textile Processing):**
- Weavers produced raw cloth
- Fullers cleaned and finished it
- Disputes over which stage added more value
- Sometimes merged into single guilds

**Carpenters vs. Joiners vs. Cabinetmakers:**
- Overlapping skills and products
- Different specializations claimed
- Sometimes violent territorial disputes

**Masons vs. Carpenters (Building Trades):**
- Stone construction vs. timber construction
- Competition for major building projects
- Different engineering approaches

**Artists' Guild Competition:**
- Painters, sculptors, goldsmiths competed for patronage
- Different cities had different specialties
- Traveling artists spread innovations

### Anti-Competitive Practices

Guilds engaged in what we would now consider anti-competitive behavior:

**Monopoly Enforcement:**
- Only guild members could practice within city limits
- Non-guild work subject to confiscation and fines
- Barriers to entry protected existing members

**Price Fixing:**
- Standardized prices for common goods
- Prevented undercutting between members
- Maintained stable but higher prices for consumers

**Production Limits:**
- Limited number of apprentices per master
- Restricted total production capacity
- Prevented oversupply and price competition

**Exclusion of Outsiders:**
- High fees and long apprenticeships limited entry
- Non-citizens excluded from guild membership
- Rural producers discriminated against

## Quality Regulation Systems

### The Two-Level Assessment System

Medieval guilds implemented sophisticated quality control:

**Level 1: Promotion Exams (升级考试)**
- Conducted during apprenticeship
- Tested skills at various stages
- Determined readiness for advancement
- Feedback for improvement

**Level 2: Graduation Assessment (结业考核)**
- Final certification as journeyman
- Comprehensive skill demonstration
- Evaluated by multiple masters
- Formal recognition and celebration

### Quality Inspection Systems

**Regular Guild Inspections:**
- **Annual or semi-annual inspections** of all members
- Guild officials examined products
- Substandard work marked for correction
- Repeat offenders could lose membership

**Market Inspections:**
- Guild inspectors monitored market stalls
- Checked products being sold
- Could confiscate poor quality goods
- Protected consumers and guild reputation

**Workshop Inspections:**
- Masters could inspect other masters' workshops
- Peered reviewed each other's work
- Maintained standards through mutual oversight
- Informal visits plus formal annual inspections

### Specific Quality Standards

**Standardized Products:**
- Guilds established **unified specifications**
- Standard sizes, weights, measurements
- Bakers: loaves must meet minimum weight
- Masons: stones cut to standard dimensions
- Weavers: cloth of specified thread count

**Quality Consequences:**
- **Bread too small?** Donate to charity (no sale)
- **Weak cloth?** Burn it and remake it
- **Poor metalwork?** Melt it down and start over
- **Faulty construction?** Rebuild at your expense

**Material Quality:**
- Guilds regulated **raw material quality**
- Only certain suppliers approved
- Material inspections before use
- Rejected materials couldn't be used

### The Masterpiece as Quality Assurance

The masterpiece system ensured only qualified craftsmen became masters:

**Masterpiece Requirements:**
- Demonstrate **all major skills** in the craft
- Show both technical expertise and design ability
- Exhibit innovation within tradition
- Prove ability to produce consistent quality

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Technical execution (craftsmanship)
- Design and proportion (artistic sense)
- Material choice and handling (knowledge)
- Innovation degree (advancement of craft)
- Consistency and finish (attention to detail)

**Outcomes:**
- **Pass:** Become master, open workshop
- **Fail:** Continue as journeyman, try again later
- **Exceptional:** Masterpiece kept by guild as example

## Teaching Moment Templates

### The Demonstration Format

**Template 1: Basic Technique Introduction**

```
[Master calls apprentice over]

MASTER: "[Name], come here. Watch closely."

[Master performs task slowly, explaining each step]

MASTER: "See how I hold the tool? Not like this [shows wrong way],
         but like this [shows right way]. Feel the difference?"

APPRENTICE: "Yes, master."

MASTER: "The material responds to proper touch. Force nothing.
         Work with it, not against it."

[Master performs task again at normal speed]

MASTER: "Your turn. Remember what you saw."

[Apprentice attempts task]

MASTER: [Provides specific feedback] "Better. But try..."
```

**Template 2: Corrective Teaching**

```
[Master notices apprentice's mistake]

MASTER: "Stop, [Name]. Look at what you're doing."

[Master points out the problem]

MASTER: "See here? This joint will not hold.
         The wood will shrink and crack."

APPRENTICE: "I didn't notice..."

MASTER: "That is why you have seven years of apprenticeship.
         To learn to notice."

[Master demonstrates correct technique]

MASTER: "Feel how the grain runs here?
         You were cutting against it."

[Master explains the principle]

MASTER: "Always follow the material's will.
         It knows how it wants to be shaped."
```

**Template 3: Progressive Responsibility**

```
[After apprentice masters basic task]

MASTER: "You have learned this task well.
         Today you try the next level."

APPRENTICE: "But I've only practiced for a few months..."

MASTER: "And you have learned it well. A good teacher
         knows when a student is ready. I believe you are ready."

[Master demonstrates slightly more complex task]

MASTER: "It builds on what you know.
         Watch the difference..."

[Apprentice attempts task]

MASTER: "Good. Not perfect, but good.
         Practice will make it master work."
```

**Template 4: Secret Knowledge Transmission**

```
[After years of trust]

MASTER: "[Name], come close. Lock the door."

APPRENTICE: "Is something wrong, master?"

MASTER: "No, something right. You have proven yourself worthy.
         Today I teach you the guild secret."

[Master leans in, speaks quietly]

MASTER: "This knowledge is not written in any book.
         It passes from master to worthy apprentice."

[Master demonstrates secret technique]

MASTER: "This is what makes our work superior.
         Never share this outside the guild."

APPRENTICE: "I swear it, master."

MASTER: "I know. I have watched you for seven years.
         I chose the right apprentice."
```

### Critical Feedback Templates

**Template: Constructive Criticism**

```
MASTER: "The work is competent. But competent is not master work."

APPRENTICE: "I thought it was good..."

MASTER: "It is good. Good enough for a journeyman, perhaps.
         But look here [points out detail].
         This joinery shows haste."

APPRENTICE: "I wanted to finish..."

MASTER: "The customer will not remember if you finished one day early.
         They will remember if this joint fails in five years.
         Quality is your signature. Make it one you're proud of."
```

**Template: Corrective Action**

```
MASTER: "This work cannot be sold. It is not guild quality."

APPRENTICE: "But it took me a week..."

MASTER: "Then you should be ashamed to waste a week on such work.
         Start again."

APPRENTICE: "Start again? All of it?"

MASTER: "Every piece. The material deserves better.
         The guild deserves better.
         You deserve better.
         Do not put your name on work you cannot defend."
```

**Template: Recognition of Excellence**

```
MASTER: "[Name], come look at this work."

[Other masters gather]

MASTER: "This apprentice has produced what I would call
         journeyman quality work. Perhaps even..."

APPRENTICE: "Master? Is it truly..."

MASTER: "Truly. The guild inspectors would approve this.
         You honor your master, you honor the guild,
         and most importantly, you honor yourself with this work."

[Formal recognition]

MASTER: "Let it be known that [Name] has advanced beyond
         apprentice standards. The journeyman examination
         comes early for this one."
```

## Quality Standards Dialogue

### Inspection and Evaluation

**Master Inspecting Apprentice Work:**

```
MASTER: "Show me your work, [Name]."

APPRENTICE: [Shows piece]

MASTER: "Walk me through your process."

APPRENTICE: "Well, I started with the rough cut, then..."

MASTER: "The cut is acceptable. But this finish...
         Run your hand over it. Feel the roughness?"

APPRENTICE: "I hadn't noticed..."

MASTER: "That is why masters inspect. We see what apprentices miss.
         The customer will feel it. That is all that matters."

MASTER: "Sand it again. Then bring it to me.
         Quality is not an accident."
```

**Master Inspecting Journeyman Work:**

```
MASTER: "This is competent journeyman work, [Name]."

JOURNEYMAN: "Just competent?"

MASTER: "Competent with hints of mastery.
         This joint shows innovation.
         But this finish... It rushes."

JOURNEYMAN: "I was trying to complete it quickly..."

MASTER: "A journeyman thinks of completion time.
         A master thinks of使用寿命 (service life).
         When your customers' grandchildren are still using this piece,
         then you will understand the difference."

JOURNEYMAN: "Then you think I'm ready for masterpiece?"

MASTER: "Not yet. But you approach.
         Another year of travel, another year of practice.
         The masterpiece comes when the craft is in your hands,
         not your head."
```

### Customer Quality Negotiations

**Explaining Price to Customer:**

```
CUSTOMER: "Why does your guild charge so much more than others?"

CRAFTSMAN: "Have you seen our work, sir?"

CUSTOMER: "It looks fine, but..."

CRAFTSMAN: "Examine this joint. See how it fits?
            No gaps, no forcing. It was shaped to fit,
            not forced to fit."

CUSTOMER: "I suppose..."

CRAFTSMAN: "And this material? It was selected for grain and strength.
            Not the cheapest, but the best.
            It will not warp, it will not crack.
            Your grandchildren will use this piece."

CUSTOMER: "That's a long time..."

CRAFTSMAN: "Quality costs once. Poor quality costs forever.
            What price do you put on a lifetime of use?"
```

**Defect Discussions:**

```
CUSTOMER: "This work is defective. It cracked after only a year!"

MASTER: [Examines piece] "You are right.
         This should not happen with guild work."

CUSTOMER: "I demand my money back!"

MASTER: "You shall have it, and a replacement.
         Which master produced this work?"

[Master inspects for guild mark]

MASTER: "This bears Master [Name]'s mark.
         This is unlike him.
         Rest assured, the guild will investigate."

CUSTOMER: "What good does that do me?"

MASTER: "It ensures this does not happen to others.
         The guild stands behind its work.
         Always. You will receive a proper replacement,
         and we will inspect all of Master [Name]'s recent work.
         Quality is not just a promise. It is a guarantee."
```

### Guild Quality Enforcement

**Guild Inspection Dialogue:**

```
[Master Inspectors enter workshop]

INSPECTOR: "Master [Name], the guild requires inspection."

CRAFTSMAN: "Of course. My work is ready for examination."

INSPECTOR: [Examines pieces] "This is excellent work.
           This... this has problems."

CRAFTSMAN: "Problems?"

INSPECTOR: "The joinery is weak.
           This will not hold under stress.
           You know better."

CRAFTSMAN: "It was a rush order..."

INSPECTOR: "The guild does not accept rush orders as excuse.
           This work cannot be sold.
           It must be redone or destroyed."

CRAFTSMAN: "Destroyed? But the materials..."

INSPECTOR: "Then you should not have wasted them on poor work.
           The guild's reputation is more valuable than any material.
           Fix it. We return in one week."

CRAFTSMAN: "Yes, Inspector. It will be done."

INSPECTOR: "See that it is.
           The guild cannot afford shoddy work from any member."
```

## Implementation Notes for MineWright

### Applying to Foreman/Worker Dynamics

**The Foreman as Master:**
- Views construction as sacred craft tradition
- Takes pride in guild standards and quality
- Sees teaching as duty and honor
- Inspects work with critical but constructive eye
- Uses guild language ("the craft," "the guild," "standards")

**Workers as Journeymen/Apprentices:**
- Respectful of Foreman's expertise
- Eager to prove themselves worthy
- Learn through demonstration and practice
- Take pride in advancing their skills
- Aspire to eventual mastery

**Key Dynamics to Implement:**
1. **Teaching moments** - Foreman demonstrates, worker imitates
2. **Quality inspections** - Foreman critiques, worker improves
3. **Progress recognition** - Advancement from apprentice to journeyman
4. **Craft pride** - Both take pride in quality work
5. **Guild identity** - "We are the Builders Guild"

### Sample Dialogue Integration

```
FOREMAN: "Watch closely, apprentice. The cornerstone must be perfect."
WORKER: "Yes, Foreman. I'm watching."
FOREMAN: "The entire structure rests on this foundation.
          Quality here means quality everywhere."
WORKER: "I understand, Foreman."
FOREMAN: "Your turn. Remember what you saw."
```

```
FOREMAN: "This work is not guild quality, worker."
WORKER: "I thought it was good enough..."
FOREMAN: "Good enough is not the guild standard.
          Quality is your signature. Make it one you're proud of."
WORKER: "I'll redo it, Foreman."
FOREMAN: "See that you do. The guild's reputation depends on it."
```
