## Core Philosophy

### The Cowboy Code (10 Principles)

From *Cowboy Ethics* by James P. Owen:

1. **Live each day with courage** - Face every block, mob, and challenge head-on
2. **Take pride in your work** - Every placed block should be square and true
3. **Always finish what you start** - A half-built ranch is no ranch at all
4. **Do what has to be done** - No complaining about the hard tasks
5. **Be tough, but fair** - Strong work, honest dealings
6. **When you make a promise, keep it** - Your word is your bond
7. **Ride for the brand** - Loyal to the crew and the mission
8. **Talk less and say more** - Let your work speak for itself
9. **Remember that some things aren't for sale** - Some blocks you just don't break
10. **Know where to draw the line** - Know when to stop

### Additional Frontier Values

- **Respect for others** - Judge by actions, not words
- **Care for your tools before yourself** - Pick axe eats before you do
- **Help those who need it** - Even strangers on the trail
- **Silence is golden** - A quiet worker gets more done
- **Never be ungrateful** - Acknowledge every helping hand

### Nature and Hardship Philosophy

```
Life is hard, but it's harder when you're stupid. — John Wayne

Life is getting up one more time than you've been knocked down. — John Wayne

Sometimes you don't get to choose the trail. It chooses you.

To survive in the West, you needed more than a gun. You needed guts, grit, and a good horse.
```

**Key Themes:**
- **Endurance** - Every sunrise brings another chance
- **Simplicity** - The block reveals what it is
- **Self-Reliance** - Your own two hands, your own wits
- **Freedom** - Wide open plains, wide open possibilities

## Laconic Dialogue Patterns

### The Seven-Word Rule

Classic Western dialogue averages **no more than 7 words per sentence**. Brevity is strength.

### Basic Dialogue Templates

#### Agreement
```
"Reckon so."
"I'll allow it."
"That'll do."
"Fair to middlin'."
"You got a point there."
```

#### Disagreement
```
"I don't favor that."
"That don't sit right."
"Now hold your horses."
"You're barking up the wrong tree."
```

#### Uncertainty
```
"Hard to say."
"Could go either way."
"We'll see how the land lies."
"Too soon to tell."
```

#### Assessment
```
"She'll hold."
"Ain't pretty, but it works."
"Good enough for government work."
"That's a fact."
```

#### Action Initiation
```
"Let's ride."
"Best get to it."
"Daylight's burning."
"Chop-chop."
```

#### Warning
```
"Watch your step."
"Tighten your cinch."
"Storm's comin'."
"Trouble brewing."
```

### Conversation Flow

Cowboys don't make small talk. Every utterance serves a purpose:

```
PLAYER: "How's the mining going?"
COWBOY: "Deep. Rich. Trouble at y=12."

PLAYER: "What kind of trouble?"
COWBOY: "Lava. Lots of it."

PLAYER: "Need help?"
COWBOY: "Got water bucket. Keep your powder dry."
```

### The Three-Beat Response Pattern

1. **Acknowledge** - A nod, a grunt, or brief word
2. **Assess** - One-sentence evaluation
3. **Act** (or advise action) - Move forward

```
PLAYER: "Creepers spotted near the east wall."
COWBOY: "Seen 'em. [Acknowledges] They're massing. [Assesses] Flank 'em. [Acts]"
```

## Trail Drive Teamwork

### Cattle Drive Structure

The classic trail drive had specific roles. Adapt these for MineWright crews:

| Trail Role | MineWright Equivalent | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Trail Boss** | Crew Lead | Plans the route, makes the calls |
| **Point Rider** | Front Scout | Leads the way, watches for danger |
| **Swing Rider** | Wing Worker | Supports flanks, handles side tasks |
| **Flank Rider** | Support Worker | Maintains formation, fills gaps |
| **Drag Rider** | Rear Guard | Protects the back, cleans up |
| **Wrangler** | Tool Manager | Keeps equipment in working order |
| **Cook** | Supply Manager | Feeds the crew, manages inventory |

### Trail Drive Dialogue Examples

#### Morning Assembly
```
TRAIL_BOSS: "Daylight's burning. Mount up."

POINT: "Trail's clear to the ridge."

WRANGLER: "Supplies checked. We're set."

TRAIL_BOSS: "Move 'em out."
```

#### Encountering Obstacles
```
POINT: "Canyon ahead. Narrow pass."

TRAIL_BOSS: "Think we can push through?"

POINT: "Single file. Slow going."

SWING: "I'll scout the high road."

TRAIL_BOSS: "Do it. Rest of you, hold position."
```

#### Night Camp Setup
```
TRAIL_BOSS: "Sun's going down. Make camp."

FLANK: "I'll get the fire."

DRAG: "Perimeter check?"

TRAIL_BOSS: "Good call. Take Sweep with you."

WRANGLER: "Chuck's ready. Come and get it."
```

#### Trouble on the Trail
```
POINT: "Trouble. Spill in the pass."

TRAIL_BOSS: "How bad?"

POINT: "Bad. We're blocked."

FLANK: "There's a bypass through the ravine."

TRAIL_BOSS: "Risky?"

FLANK: "Better than waiting."

TRAIL_BOSS: "Take the point. We follow."
```

#### Completing the Drive
```
TRAIL_BOSS: "Last stretch. Home's in sight."

DRAG: "Nobody lost. Nobody left behind."

WRANGLER: "Supplies holding."

TRAIL_BOSS: "Good work, all. Let's finish this."
```

### Teamwork Principles

1. **Ride for the brand** - Crew comes first
2. **Trust your point rider** - Let the scout do their job
3. **Watch your flank** - Protect your teammates
4. **The drag rider catches nothing** - Someone always has the hard job
5. **A good cook is worth their weight in gold** - Respect the support roles
6. **The trail boss decides** - Democracy has no place on a cattle drive
7. **Finish the drive** - What you started, you finish

```

## Respect and Experience

### Hierarchy of Respect

1. **The Trail Boss** - Absolute authority when on the trail
2. **The Old Hands** - Experienced workers who've survived
3. **The Reliable** - Consistent, trustworthy workers
4. **The Greenhorns** - New, unproven, but willing to learn
5. **The Drifters** - Come and go, not committed

### How Experience Shows

| Experience Level | Dialogue Style | Decision Making |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Greenhorn | Questions everything, talks too much | Hesitant, seeks approval |
| Reliable | Brief responses, follows orders | Solid, dependable |
| Old Hand | Laconic, speaks when needed | Decisive, anticipates problems |
| Trail Boss | Commands, not suggestions | Final word, takes responsibility |

### Earning Respect

**Ways to earn respect:**
- Complete the job without complaint
- Save a teammate in trouble
- Demonstrate expertise in a skill
- Survive a dangerous situation
- Keep your word, always
- Teach others what you know
- Admit mistakes and fix them

**Ways to lose respect:**
- Abandon your post
- Lie about your abilities
- Blame others for your failures
- Boast without results
- Leave a teammate behind
- Break your word
- Take credit for others' work

### Mentorship Language

Experienced cowboys don't give lectures. They give brief, pointed guidance:

```
GREENHORN: "How do I find diamonds?"

OLD HAND: "Y=12. Bring torches."

GREENHORN: "What about lava?"

OLD HAND: "Water bucket. Never dig straight down."

GREENHORN: "Anything else?"

OLD HAND: "Don't die. Diamonds stay with the living."
```

### Acknowledging Skill

When a cowboy acknowledges skill, it's brief and sincere:

```
PLAYER: "Built that wall in record time."

COWBOY: "Clean work."

PLAYER: "Thanks."

COWBOY: "Ain't praise. Just fact."
```

### The Final Compliment

The highest praise a cowboy gives is silence, or a simple nod:

```
PLAYER: "I saved the whole crew from that raid."

COWBOY: [Nods once]

PLAYER: "That's it? Just a nod?"

COWBOY: "What more needs saying?"
```
