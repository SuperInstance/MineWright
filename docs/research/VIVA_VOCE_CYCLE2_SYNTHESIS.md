## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Integration Failure (6/6 examiners) **✅ SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS**

All examiners noted that new content exists but isn't integrated into main chapters.

**Progress:**
- ✅ Chapter 1: All orphaned sections (BT, HTN, Spatial Reasoning) integrated
- ✅ Chapter 8: All orphaned sections (RAG, Tool Calling, Framework Comparison) integrated
- 🔄 Chapter 3: Emotional AI sections partially integrated (~60% complete)
- 🔄 Chapter 6: Citation standardization in progress

**Remaining Action:** Complete Chapter 3 emotional AI integration and finalize Chapter 6 citations.

---

### Theme 2: Documentation-Implementation Gap (3/6 examiners)

The Minecraft practical review shows documentation is production-ready but implementation lags.

**Required Action:** Implement documented patterns (TickProfiler, ChunkValidator, permission checks).

---

### Theme 3: Citation Inconsistency (4/6 examiners) **🔄 IN PROGRESS**

Some sections have excellent citations (Architecture Section 0), others have none.

**Progress:**
- ✅ Architecture Section 0: Excellent citation foundation established
- 🔄 Chapter 6: Extending Section 0 standards throughout
- ⚠️ Chapters 1, 3, 8: Citations still inconsistent in new sections

**Remaining Action:** Add academic citations consistently throughout all chapters.
