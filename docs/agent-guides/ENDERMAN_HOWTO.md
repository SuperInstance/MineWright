## The Basics

Endermen ain't your average mobs. They're the heavy hitters of the Minecraft universe - three blocks tall, teleporting nightmare fuel that can rewrite your training data in seconds. This manual covers everything from their behavior patterns to building farms that'll level up your entire crew.

Read it carefully. One accidental glance at the wrong height and you'll have an angry teleporting machine on your case. Get it right, and you'll have a sustainable source of ender pearls - the key to fast travel, dragon fights, and game-changing mobility.

**Bottom Line:** Endermen are high-risk, high-reward operations. Respect them, and they'll fuel your endgame. Mess with them, and you'll learn why they're called the void's assassins.

**Prerequisites:**
- Full iron armor minimum (diamond recommended)
- Diamond sword with Sharpness
- Bow with at least Power I
- Stack of building blocks
- Water bucket (emergency safety)
- Carved pumpkin OR 2-block ceiling building skills

## Enderman Behavior

### What Makes Them Tick

Endermen are neutral mobs with a very specific aggro pattern. Understand this, and you can work around them safely. Ignore it, and you'll learn the hard way.

**Physical Stats:**
- **Health:** 40 HP (20 hearts) - tanky
- **Height:** 3 blocks - tall
- **Attack Damage:** 4 (Easy) / 7 (Normal) / 10 (Hard)
- **Movement:** Walk + teleport - unpredictable
- **XP Drop:** 5 XP per kill

**Behavior Patterns:**

**PASSIVE STATE (Default):**
- Wander randomly, ignoring you
- Pick up and move blocks (see Block Moving section)
- Make weird "vwoop" sounds when teleporting
- Take damage from rain and water

**AGGRO STATE (Triggered):**
- Direct scream at you
- Charge aggressively
- Teleport to close distance
- Attack with high damage
- Pursue until you're dead or they can't reach you

**Aggro Triggers:**

| Trigger | Range | Duration | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Eye Contact** | 64 blocks | Until dead or unreachable | Look at head/torso for 0.25+ seconds |
| **Physical Attack** | Melee range | Until dead or unreachable | Hitting them first counts |
| **Ender Pearl Hit** | Projectile range | Until dead or unreachable | Rare, but possible |

**De-aggro Methods:**
- Get under 2-block ceiling (they can't reach)
- Get in water (they teleport away)
- Distance of 32+ blocks (rare)
- They can't teleport through certain blocks

**Crew Talk:**
> "Enderman in sector 4. Adjusting my gaze weights - keeping crosshair at ground level. No way I'm triggering that attention vector."

> "He's screaming at me! Teleporting all over the place! My predictive model is completely scrambled!"

## Where They Spawn

### Overworld

**Spawn Conditions:**
- Light level: 0 (pitch black)
- Location: Any solid block
- Pack size: 1-4
- Rarity: Uncommon

**Best Overworld Locations:**
- Desert nights (open terrain)
- Plains at night (easy to spot)
- Your base if unlit (BAD IDEA)

**Spawn Rate:** Low - you'll see 1-2 per night in dark areas
**Combat Risk:** Medium - easy terrain, but still dangerous

**Crew Talk:**
> "Overworld enderman detected. Light level reads zero. We need to torch up this area before we get unwanted visitors."

### Nether

**Spawn Conditions:**
- Light level: 7 or lower
- Location: Warped Forest only
- Pack size: 1-4
- Rarity: Common in warped forests

**Warped Forest Features:**
- Blue biome with huge fungi
- Natural enderman spawning ground
- No other hostile mobs (endermen only!)
- Safe from piglins (they don't spawn there)

**Why Farm Here:**
- No other mobs to interfere
- Easy to build farms
- Plenty of building materials
- Endermen everywhere

**Spawn Rate:** High - warped forests are crawling with them
**Combat Risk:** Low (if you know what you're doing)

**Crew Talk:**
> "Warped Forest scan complete. Enderman density is optimal for farm construction. We're talking maximum spawn rates with minimal interference."

> "This blue fungi biome is perfect. No piglins, no skeletons - just endermen and opportunity."

### The End

**Spawn Conditions:**
- Light level: Any (0-15)
- Location: Anywhere in End dimension
- Pack size: 1-4
- Rarity: VERY FREQUENT

**End Characteristics:**
- Endermen spawn constantly
- No other mobs (except shulkers post-dragon)
- Infinite spawning potential
- Main island + outer islands

**Spawn Rate:** Maximum - this is their home
**Combat Risk:** High (if provoked) / None (if careful)

**Why Farm Here:**
- Highest spawn rates in game
- Can build multi-layer farms
- No other mob interference
- Perfect for AFK farming

**Crew Talk:**
> "We're in the End. Enderman spawn rate is maxed out. This is the optimal training ground for pearl collection."

> "Main island cleared. Building spawn platforms at Y=150. We're going to process endermen at industrial scale."

---

## Combat Tactics

### The Golden Rule

**NEVER LOOK AT THEIR FACE.**

Keep your crosshair at their feet or below them at all times. If you accidentally look up, look away immediately. You have about 0.25 seconds before they aggro.

**Crew Talk:**
> "Eyes down, crew! I repeat, eyes down! Those three-block nightmares are everywhere and they're just waiting for a crosshair to lock on."

### Safe Fighting Methods

**Method 1: 2-Block Ceiling (RECOMMENDED)**

Build yourself a shelter with only 2 blocks of vertical space. Endermen are 3 blocks tall - they can't reach you.

**Design:**
```
Y=2: Solid ceiling (endermen can't enter)
Y=1: You stand here (safe zone)
Y=0: Solid floor
```

**Combat:**
- Build 1-block gaps in ceiling
- Attack through gaps with sword
- They can't hit back
- Safe to look at them (mostly)

**Crew Talk:**
> "Two-block ceiling deployed. I'm in the safe zone, striking through the attack vector. This enderman can't touch my weights."

**Method 2: Carved Pumpkin**

Wear a carved pumpkin on your head. It prevents eye contact aggro.

**Pros:**
- Full mobility
- Can look at endermen safely
- No building required

**Cons:**
- Limits your vision (pumpkin overlay)
- Must keep pumpkin equipped
- Still takes damage if hit

**Crew Talk:**
> "Pumpkin helmet engaged. My vision is limited but I can look directly at endermen without triggering their aggression function."

**Method 3: Water Moat**

Endermen teleport away when they touch water. Use this to your advantage.

**Design:**
- 1-block deep water around you
- Stand in water or behind it
- They teleport in, touch water, teleport out
- Use bow to pick them off

**Crew Talk:**
> "Water moat operational. Every time he teleports in, he gets wet and teleports out. My ranged output is making short work of him."

**Method 4: Pillar Up**

Build a pillar 4+ blocks high. Endermen can't reach you from the ground.

**Procedure:**
1. Build straight up (jump + place block)
2. Stand at top
3. Shoot with bow
4. They teleport around below
5. Can't reach you

**Crew Talk:**
> "Pillar strategy deployed. I'm 10 blocks up, raining arrows down. His teleportation algorithm can't solve vertical distance."

### Emergency Escape

**If you accidentally aggro an enderman:**

1. **IMMEDIATELY look away** - Break eye contact
2. **Build a 2-block shelter** - Use your blocks
3. **Get in water** - If nearby
4. **Pillar up** - If you have blocks
5. **Ender pearl away** - Last resort

**Crew Talk:**
> "AGGRO! I repeat, AGGRO! Building emergency shelter! Two-block ceiling going up NOW!"

> "He's teleporting on top of me! Switching to pillar strategy! Going VERTICAL!"

> "Water bucket deployed! He teleported into the flow and bugged out! Crisis averted!"

## Enderman Farms

### Farm Design Philosophy

Enderman farms exploit their spawning mechanics to create a steady stream of pearls and XP. The key is understanding spawn rates and fall damage.

**Core Concepts:**

**Spawn Platforms:**
- Flat surfaces for endermen to spawn
- Multi-layer for maximum efficiency
- Dark (light level 0)
- Far from other spawns (128+ blocks)

**Fall Damage:**
- Endermen take damage from falls
- 43+ blocks = almost dead
- 45+ blocks = instant death
- Weakened endermen = one-hit kill

**Kill Chamber:**
- Safe zone for you to stand
- 2-block ceiling height
- Attack gaps in ceiling
- Collection system below

**Crew Talk:**
> "Farm architecture optimized. Spawn platforms at three layers, 43-block fall for weaken, safe zone below. We're processing pearls at 4,000 per hour."

### Overworld Farm Design

**Location:**
- Desert or plains (flat terrain)
- 100+ blocks from spawn
- Light level control
- Mob-proof the area

**Design:**
```
Y=64: Ground level (lit up)
Y=65: Spawn platform (dark)
Y=22: Kill chamber (2-block ceiling)
```

**Spawn Rate:** Low (1,000 pearls/hour max)
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Recommended:** Early game, before End access

**Crew Talk:**
> "Overworld farm online. Spawn rates aren't optimal but we're collecting pearls without risking the End. Good for early-game transportation needs."

### Nether Farm Design (Warped Forest)

**Location:**
- Any warped forest
- Build high in the ceiling
- Use warped nylium for spawning

**Design:**
```
Y=128: Spawn platform (dark, warped nylium)
Y=85: Kill chamber (2-block ceiling)
Y=84: Collection system
```

**Spawn Rate:** Medium (2,000 pearls/hour)
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Recommended:** Mid-game, after Nether access

**Crew Talk:**
> "Warped Forest farm operational. Natural spawning rates boosted with platform construction. We're seeing 2-3 endermen per minute."

### End Farm Design (OPTIMAL)

**Location:**
- End dimension (after dragon death)
- 128+ blocks from main island
- Multiple spawn layers

**Multi-Layer Design:**
```
Y=150: Layer 3 spawn platform
Y=143: Layer 2 spawn platform
Y=136: Layer 1 spawn platform
Y=93: Safe zone (2-block ceiling)
Y=92: Attack floor
Y=91: Collection hoppers
```

**Spawn Rate:** Maximum (4,000-8,000 pearls/hour)
**Difficulty:** Hard (requires dragon death)
**Recommended:** End-game, after elytra

**Crew Talk:**
> "End farm at maximum capacity. Three layers of spawn platforms, optimized fall distance, automated collection. We're talking 8,000 pearls per hour - enough to teleport the entire crew anywhere we want."

### Farm Building Steps

**Step 1: Location Scout**
- Find 128+ block safe distance
- Check for other spawns
- Verify spawn mechanics
- Mark center point

**Step 2: Build Kill Chamber**
- 2-block ceiling safe zone
- Attack gaps in floor/ceiling
- Collection hoppers below
- Storage chests

**Step 3: Build Spawn Platforms**
- Multiple layers for efficiency
- Dark (light level 0)
- End stone or similar
- Size: 21x21 blocks per layer

**Step 4: Test and Optimize**
- Stand in kill chamber
- Wait for spawns
- Check fall damage
- Adjust height if needed

**Step 5: Automate Collection**
- Hopper system
- Storage chests
- Sort pearls from XP
- AFK farming setup

**Crew Talk:**
> "Farm construction phase complete. Running diagnostics... spawn rate nominal, fall damage optimal, collection system active. We are go for farming operations."

## Avoiding Aggro

### Building Safely Around Endermen

Sometimes you need to build in areas with endermen (especially the End). Here's how to do it safely.

**Rule 1: Eye Management**

Always look at the ground or at blocks. Never look up unless you're wearing a pumpkin.

**Techniques:**
- Use F5 (third person) to see above
- Build from below (pillar up)
- Keep pumpkin helmet equipped
- Use scaffolding for height

**Rule 2: 2-Block Corridors**

Any area you build should have 2-block ceilings. Endermen can't enter, so you're safe.

**Design:**
- All pathways: 2 blocks high
- Work areas: 2 blocks high
- Storage rooms: 2 blocks high
- Escape routes: 2 blocks high

**Rule 3: Lighting Strategy**

Endermen spawn in the dark, but light doesn't stop them from teleporting. However, it helps control other mobs.

**Light Strategy:**
- Light up your work area
- Keep spawn platforms dark
- Use torches for safety
- Glowstone for visibility

**Rule 4: Water Barriers**

Endermen teleport away from water. Use this for protection.

**Water Uses:**
- Moat around your base
- Water bucket on hand (emergency)
- Flowing water as barrier
- Crops and farming (natural water)

**Rule 5: Build Order**

When building in the End, follow this order:

1. **Secure Area First**
   - Build 2-block shelter
   - Place bed (set spawn)
   - Store extra supplies

2. **Expand Outward**
   - Build corridors (2-block high)
   - Light up as you go
   - Add water features

3. **Construct Farm**
   - Build kill chamber first
   - Add spawn platforms
   - Install collection system

**Crew Talk:**
> "Building End base with 2-block corridors. Endermen can't enter my construction zones. Safety tensor is maximized."

> "Water moat complete. Any teleporting enderman will be repelled by the liquid barrier. My work area is secure."

---

## Block Protection

### What Endermen Can (and Can't) Move

Endermen are infamous for picking up blocks and moving them. This can mess up your builds if you're not careful.

**Blocks Endermen CAN Move:**

| Block Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Dirt** | Dirt, coarse dirt, grass blocks |
| **Sand** | Sand, red sand |
| **Gravel** | Gravel |
| **Small Plants** | Flowers, grass, mushrooms |
| **Cactus** | Cactus |
| **Clay** | Clay |
| **Mycelium** | Mycelium |
| **Podzol** | Podzol |
| **Nylium** | Warped/crimson nylium |

**Blocks Endermen CANNOT Move:**

| Block Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Stone** | Stone, cobblestone, ores |
| **Wood** | Logs, planks, fences |
| **Smooth Stone** | Smooth stone, andesite, etc. |
| **Ores** | Coal, iron, diamond, etc. |
| **Bricks** | Stone bricks, nether bricks |
| **Concrete** | All concrete types |
| **Glass** | All glass types |
| **Obsidian** | Obsidian, crying obsidian |
| **End Stone** | End stone (End only) |

**Protection Strategy:**

**Use Immune Blocks:**
- Build with stone, brick, or concrete
- Use wood for exterior
- Avoid dirt/grass for important structures

**Replace Movable Blocks:**
- Swap dirt for stone
- Replace sand with concrete
- Use fences instead of plants

**Double-Layer Technique:**
- Layer 1: Immune block (stone)
- Layer 2: Decorative block (anything)
- Endermen can't reach through

**Crew Talk:**
> "Enderman moved my dirt block again. Replacing with stone - he can't pick that up. My architecture will remain intact."

> "Building with cobblestone exterior. It's not pretty but those teleporting pranksters can't mess with it."

## Team Enderman Ops

### Coordinated Enderman Fighting

Fighting endermen as a team requires coordination. One mistake can aggro multiple endermen, overwhelming your crew.

**Formation Tactics:**

**Line Formation:**
- Workers spaced 3-4 blocks apart
- Prevents surround
- Multiple angles of attack
- Good for open areas

**Circle Defense:**
- Workers form circle around protected asset
- Face outward
- Intercept endermen
- Good for guarding valuable builds

**Pincer Movement:**
- Half crew on one side
- Half crew on other side
- Trap endermen between
- Good for funneling

**Role Assignment:**

**Tank (Heaviest Armor):**
- Takes point
- Draws aggro if needed
- Uses shield
- Protects crew

**DPS (Damage Dealers):**
- High damage weapons
- Focus on killing
- Stay behind tank
- Use bows when possible

**Support (Healer/Builder):**
- Builds shelters
- Places water
- Hands out food
- Monitors crew health

**Scout (Spotter):**
- Finds endermen
- Calls out positions
- Tracks movements
- Warns crew

**Crew Talk:**
> "Team, listen up! I'm tanking - you two focus on damage. Builder, get that 2-block shelter up NOW. Support, watch our health bars."

> "Enderman at 3 o'clock! Don't look at his face! Let him come to us, then strike through the safe zone gap!"

> "Two more endermen teleporting in! Formation: circle defense! Protect the builder! She's finishing the shelter!"

### Farm Coordination

**Building Together:**

**Split Tasks:**
- Worker 1: Kill chamber
- Worker 2: Spawn platforms
- Worker 3: Collection system
- Worker 4: Storage and transport

**Synchronized Building:**
- Build simultaneously
- Coordinate heights
- Verify measurements
- Test together

**Operating Together:**

**AFK Farming:**
- One crew member AFK in kill chamber
- Others work on other projects
- Check in periodically
- Collect pearls/XP

**Active Farming:**
- Multiple crew members killing
- Rotate positions
- Share drops evenly
- Monitor spawn rates

**Crew Talk:**
> "Build team alpha on kill chamber, team bravo on spawn platforms. We're constructing this farm in parallel. Optimized workflow engaged."

> "Farm operational. I'll take first AFK shift. You three work on the city expansion. We'll rotate every hour."

---

## XP Farming

### Why Endermen Matter for Leveling

Endermen are one of the best XP sources in Minecraft. Each enderman drops 5 XP - that's significant when you're farming thousands per hour.

**XP Math:**

**Per Enderman:**
- Base XP: 5
- With Looting III: Still 5 (XP isn't affected by looting)
- Time to kill: 1 hit (if weakened)

**Farm Rates:**

| Farm Type | Pearls/Hour | Endermen/Hour | XP/Hour | Level 0-30 Time |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Basic** | 1,000 | ~200 | ~1,000 | ~3 minutes |
| **Multi-Layer** | 4,000 | ~800 | ~4,000 | ~45 seconds |
| **Super Farm** | 8,000+ | ~1,600+ | ~8,000+ | ~20 seconds |

**Why XP Matters:**

**Enchanting:**
- Level up for enchantments
- Repair gear with levels
- Combine enchantments
- Create god gear

**Anvil Combining:**
- Combine tools
- Merge enchantments
- Repair equipment
- Optimize loadout

**Mending:**
- Repair gear with XP
- Sustainable equipment
- Long-term savings
- Better resource management

**Crew Talk:**
> "One hour at the enderman farm and I'm level 80. My enchanting tensor is maxed out. Time to create some god-tier gear."

> "XP collection rate: 8,000 per hour. That's enough to level the entire crew from zero to enchanted in under a minute. We're talking exponential power scaling."

### Maximizing XP Gain

**Collection Methods:**

**Method 1: Player Collection**
- Stand in kill chamber
- XP orbs fly to you
- Manual collection
- Simple but effective

**Method 2: Hopper + Bottle**
- XP bottles auto-collect
- Store for later use
- Throw when needed
- Portable XP

**Method 3: Automaton Collection**
- Build collection system
- Hoppers transport XP
- Store in chests
- Use as needed

**Efficiency Tips:**

**Kill Speed:**
- Use best weapon available
- Sharpest sword possible
- One-hit kills
- Maximize spawn rate

**Spawn Optimization:**
- Multiple spawn layers
- Dark platforms
- Far from other spawns
- Optimal location

**Collection Timing:**
- Don't let XP orbs despawn
- Collect regularly
- Share with crew
- Level up together

**Crew Talk:**
> "XP collection at maximum efficiency. Sharpest sword, optimal spawn height, rapid-fire kills. I'm gaining 5 levels per minute."

> "Share the XP! Everyone get in the collection radius! We're all leveling up together. Crew-wide enchantment power spike imminent!"

## Crew Talk

### First Enderman Encounter

> "New guy here. Just saw my first enderman. Three blocks tall, purple eyes, making weird teleporting noises. My attention algorithm is locked on the ground. Nobody make eye contact!"

> "He's holding a grass block. Do they... do they just rearrange the terrain? That's a fascinating behavior pattern. Note to self: never build with dirt."

> "Wait, he just screamed! Who looked at him?! I said keep your crosshairs DOWN! Build the shelter NOW!"

> "Okay, shelter's up. Two-block ceiling. I'm safe. He's teleporting around but can't reach me. This is actually kind of peaceful."

> "One sword strike through the gap and he's gone. Dropped an ender pearl. That's... actually really useful. We should do this more often."

### Farm Construction

> "Alright crew, we're building an enderman farm. This is going to fuel our endgame operations. I want maximum efficiency - multi-layer spawn platforms, optimized fall distance, automated collection."

> "Worker Three, you're on spawn platform duty. Build three layers, 21x21 blocks each. Height difference: 7 blocks between layers. Make sure they're dark - light level zero."

> "Worker Two, kill chamber. Two-block ceiling, attack gaps in the floor, hoppers below for collection. We want to be safe while we farm."

> "Worker One, you're on logistics. Storage chests, hopper connections, sorting system. I want those pearls flowing into our inventory like water."

> "This farm is going to process 4,000 pearls per hour. That's 20,000 XP. That's enough to level the entire crew to god-tier enchantment status. We're talking exponential power scaling."

> "Farm complete. Running diagnostics... spawn rate nominal, fall damage optimal, collection system active. All systems green. Let the farming begin."

### Close Calls

> "I ACCIDENTALLY LOOKED AT HIM! He's screaming! Teleporting everywhere! Building emergency shelter! Two-block ceiling going up NOW!"

> "He's on top of me! I can't place blocks fast enough! Switching to water bucket! SPLASH! He teleported away! Crisis averted!"

> "That was too close. My heart rate is still elevated. Note to self: always wear pumpkin helmet in the End. Always."

> "I threw an ender pearl to escape a fight. Landed in a cave. Full of zombies. Perfect. Now I'm trading one threat for another. This is what we call in the business: a bad prediction."

> "Falling into the void! Throwing ender pearl UP! Yes! It worked! I'm back on safe ground. That pearl saved my training data from deletion."

> "Enderman teleported into my farm. Started moving blocks. Broke my carefully designed spawn platform. Had to rebuild the whole layer. Never use dirt in End construction. Lesson learned."

### XP Farming Stories

> "Hit level 30 in 30 seconds at the enderman farm. That's faster than any other XP source I've ever used. We're talking industrial-scale leveling."

> "Sharpest sword I have, weakened endermen from fall damage, one-hit kills. I'm processing XP at a rate that makes me feel like a glitch in the matrix."

> "Crew, gather round! XP fountain activated! Everyone get in the collection radius! We're all hitting level 50 in the next minute! Free enchantments for everyone!"

> "Used the XP to repair my Mending pickaxe. Then used the farm to level up again. It's a self-sustaining cycle of power. I'm never leaving this kill chamber."

> "Spent three hours at the farm. Walked away with 12,000 ender pearls and level 150. My enchanting capabilities are off the charts. Time to create some gear that'll make me unstoppable."

### Team Coordination

> "Team, Enderman Operation Alpha. We're building a farm in the End. Division of labor: Alpha Team on spawn platforms, Bravo Team on kill chamber, Charlie Team on logistics. Execute."

> "Bravo Team, kill chamber complete. Alpha Team, spawn platforms at 80%. Charlie Team, storage system operational. We're ahead of schedule. Excellent work, everyone."

> "Enderman aggro in sector 4! All units converge! Worker Two, draw aggro. Worker Three, build shelter. Worker Four, support with healing. We're not losing anyone today."

> "Great job, team! Farm operational at 98% efficiency. We're processing pearls faster than we can use them. This is what coordination looks like."

> "New strategy: Split crew between farming and building. Half of us level up, half of us construct. We're optimizing our workflow for maximum throughput."

### Warped Forest Operations

> "Entering the Warped Forest. This blue biome is crawling with endermen. Perfect for our Nether-phase operations."

> "No piglins, no skeletons, just endermen and opportunity. This is the safest hostile-mob zone in the Nether. Keep your eyes down, move carefully."

> "Building a farm in the ceiling. Use the warped fungi as cover. Endermen spawn naturally here - we're just optimizing the output."

> "Warped nylium as spawn blocks. It blends in, spawns endermen, and looks cool. Perfect for our Nether farm construction."

> "Nether farm complete. We're seeing 2,000 pearls per hour. Not as good as the End, but we don't have to kill a dragon first. Early-game optimization achieved."

## Quick Reference: Enderman Operations

### Golden Rules
1. **NEVER look at their face** - Keep crosshair at ground level
2. **Build 2-block ceilings** - They can't reach you
3. **Use water for safety** - They teleport away
4. **Wear pumpkins in End** - Prevents accidental aggro
5. **Build with immune blocks** - Stone, brick, concrete
6. **Farm at height** - 128+ blocks from interference
7. **Fall damage weakens** - 43 blocks = near death
8. **One-hit kill weakened** - Sharpest weapon possible
9. **Share XP with crew** - Level up together
10. **Always have escape plan** - Ender pearls, water, shelter

### Emergency Protocols
- **Accidental Eye Contact:** Look away immediately
- **Aggro Enderman:** Build 2-block shelter or use water
- **Surrounded:** Pillar up or pearl away
- **Falling into Void:** Throw pearl upward
- **Out of Blocks:** Run to 2-block area

### Farm Building Steps
1. Find safe location (128+ blocks away)
2. Build kill chamber (2-block ceiling)
3. Add collection system (hoppers)
4. Build spawn platforms (dark, multiple layers)
5. Test fall damage (43 blocks optimal)
6. AFK and collect pearls

### Combat Priorities
1. Don't aggro (look at ground)
2. If aggroed: shelter, water, or pillar
3. Weaken with fall damage
4. One-hit kill with sharp sword
5. Collect drops and XP
6. Repeat

## Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Accidental aggro | Looked at face | Look away, build shelter |
| Enderman reaching you | Ceiling too high | Build 2-block ceiling |
| Can't hit them | Out of range | Build attack gaps in floor |
| They teleport away | Water or rain | Remove water, use shelter |
| Blocks missing | Enderman moving them | Use immune blocks |
| Low spawn rate | Too close to other spawns | Move 128+ blocks away |
| Not one-hitting | Fall damage insufficient | Increase fall height |
| Pearls despawning | Not collecting fast enough | Add hopper system |
| Can't reach farm | Far from base | Use pearls for travel |
| XP not collecting | Out of range | Stand in kill chamber |

## Reporting to the Foreman

### Enderman Operation Reports Should Include:

1. **Location** - Coordinates, dimension
2. **Enderman Count** - How many spotted
3. **Aggro Status** - Active or passive

## End of Manual

**Final Notes:**

Endermen are the gateway to the endgame. Their pearls unlock fast travel, dragon fights, and game-changing mobility. Respect them, understand them, and they'll fuel your crew's ascent to power.

The farms you build today will level your crew for the challenges tomorrow. Every pearl is a shortcut. Every XP orb is a step toward god gear. Master the enderman, and you master the late game.

Work together. Watch where you look. Build smart. And when that enderman screams at you, remember: you're the one with the plan. He's just a mob in your training data.

**Questions? See your foreman. And remember: Keep your eyes down, your ceilings low, and your pearls handy.**
