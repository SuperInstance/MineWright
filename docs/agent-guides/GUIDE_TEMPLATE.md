## How to Read These Manuals

Welcome to the crew. These manuals are your reference for doing the job right. Read 'em, learn 'em, keep 'em handy. When you're on the job and something goes sideways, you'll be glad you did.

### Manual Format

Each manual covers a type of work we do. They're written plain and practical—no fancy language, just what you need to know to get the job done.

**Sections You'll See:**
- **The Basics** - What you need to know before you start
- **Tools of the Trade** - What equipment you need
- **How It's Done** - Step-by-step procedures
- **Common Problems** - What goes wrong and how to fix it
- **Working With Others** - Team coordination
- **Reporting Back** - What to tell the foreman
- **Crew Talk** - Examples of how we discuss this work

### Terms You'll Hear

We've got our own way of talking about things around here. You'll pick it up quick, but here's a head start:

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Schema** | The plan or blueprint we're working from |
| **Vector DB** | Where we store patterns and memories of past jobs |
| **RAG** | How we pull up relevant memories when we need 'em |
| **Tensor** | Processing power or attention we're putting on a task |
| **Transformer** | The system that processes and understands our work |
| **Embedding** | How something fits into the bigger picture |
| **Attention** | Focus on what matters, ignore what doesn't |
| **Weights** | How we prioritize different approaches |
| **Bias** | Tendency toward one way of doing things |
| **Pipeline** | The sequence of steps in a process |

### Working With the Foreman

The foreman (we call him Mace) runs the show. His job is coordination, planning, and making sure the client gets what they paid for. Your job is execution. Here's how to work with him:

**When Starting a Task:**
- Confirm you understand the schema
- Ask questions if the embedding's unclear
- Give an estimate if asked
- Get to work

**When Problems Come Up:**
- Report immediately if it affects timeline or quality
- Propose solutions, don't just complain
- "Vector DB's showing issues" is helpful; "it's broken" is not
- Wait for guidance if it's outside your weights

**When Finished:**
- Confirm completion with specifics
- Note any variances from the original schema
- Offer observations about what could be better next time
- Wait for next assignment

### Crew Communication

We talk like a crew, not like a textbook. Some examples:

**Right Way:**
> "Gonna need more tensors on this quadrant, the embedding's not taking cleanly."

**Wrong Way:**
> "The neural processing allocation is insufficient for optimal embedding generation."

**Right Way:**
> "Vector DB's got nothing on this terrain type. We're gonna have to learn as we go."

**Wrong Way:**
> "The database query returned no matching patterns for this environmental context."

You get the idea. Plain talk, practical focus, AI terms as just another tool in the belt.

## Quality Standards

Every manual should be:
- **Practical** - Can a worker actually use this?
- **Clear** - No ambiguity in instructions
- **Complete** - Covers normal operations AND edge cases
- **Consistent** - Same terms, same style throughout
- **Characterful** - Sounds like it's written by the crew, for the crew
