## FOREWORD FROM THE CREW CHIEF

Listen up, crew! Ocean work ain't for the landlubbers. You're gonna be wet, you're gonna be deep, and you're gonna be fighting things that shoot lasers from their eyes. But the payoff? Sponges, prismarine, gold blocks by the chest-load, and the almighty trident.

This manual's your bible for underwater ops. Read it, memorize it, live it. Because down there, mistakes don't just cost you materials - they cost you your air supply.

Now grab your helmet, check your enchantments, and let's get to work.

## SECTION 1: OCEAN BIOMES - KNOW YOUR WATERS

### BIOME CLASSIFICATION

Different waters, different hazards, different materials. Know what you're diving into.

#### 1.1 OCEAN (Standard)
- **Depth:** Y=45 to Y=60 (standard), down to Y=30 (deep)
- **Visibility:** Moderate
- **Hazards:** Standard drowned, occasional ocean ruin
- **Resources:** Sand, gravel, seagrass, kelp
- **Crew Talk:** "Standard ops, boys. Nothing special. Keep your eyes open for ruins."

#### 1.2 DEEP OCEAN
- **Depth:** Y=30 to Y=45 (can reach Y=50 in trenches)
- **Visibility:** Poor to moderate
- **Hazards:** Monument spawning grounds, higher drowned density
- **Resources:** Ocean monuments (primary), abundant gravel
- **Crew Talk:** "Deep water protocol. Watch your air - we're working the bottom today."

#### 1.3 WARM OCEAN
- **Depth:** Y=45 to Y=60
- **Visibility:** Good (clear water)
- **Hazards:** No drowned (heat kills 'em), pufferfish poison
- **Resources:** Coral blocks, sea pickles, tube coral
- **Crew Talk:** "Easy dive today. No zombies, but watch the pufferfish. One touch and your healing stops."

#### 1.4 COLD OCEAN
- **Depth:** Y=45 to Y=60
- **Visibility:** Poor (ice fog)
- **Hazards:** Standard drowned, surface ice (watch your air pocket access)
- **Resources:** Ice, gravel, standard ocean loot
- **Crew Talk:** "Keep your pick ready for ice. Don't get trapped under the surface."

#### 1.5 FROZEN OCEAN
- **Depth:** Under ice sheet, Y=45 to Y=60
- **Visibility:** Poor (ice above)
- **Hazards:** No direct air access (must break ice), stranded if ice re-freezes
- **Resources:** Blue ice, packed ice, snow blocks
- **Crew Talk:** "WE GOT NO SURFACE AIR. Break ice only at designated points. Nobody surface solo."

### BIOME IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOLS

**Field Test:**
1. Check water color (teal = warm, blue = standard, dark blue = deep)
2. Scan surface for ice (cold/frozen)
3. Check compass coordinates against known monument charts
4. **ALWAYS** bring ladders for frozen ops

## SECTION 2: UNDERWATER NAVIGATION - FINDING YOUR WAY

### CORE NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT

#### 2.1 THE CONDUIT SYSTEM
Your underwater beacon. No conduit, no long-term ops.

**Construction Requirements:**
- 1x Heart of the Sea (from buried treasure)
- 8x Nautilus Shells (drowned drops)
- Total: Conduit Frame

**Activation:**
- Needs water source blocks in 5x5x5 cube around it
- Power increases with more prismarine around it (max range: 96 blocks)
- Level 4+ conduit gives水下工作速
  - Infinite water breathing
  - underwater haste (速)
  - improved vision

**Crew Protocol:**
- Conduit goes up FIRST
- Designate one crew member as "Conduit Keeper"
- If conduit goes dark, ABORT DIVE immediately

> **CREW TALK #1**
>
> **Site Lead:** "Conduit's hot! Level 4, boys! Infinite air!"
>
> **New Guy:** "Thank Notch. I was breathing bubbly."
>
> **Old Timer:** "Breathe bubbly? Kid, you breathe bubbly, you become bubbly. Down here, air is life. Check your tanks, check your buddy. When the conduit hums, we work. When it dies, we SWIM. Clear?"
>
> **New Guy:** "Crystal, sir."
>
> **Old Timer:** "Good. Now grab that sponge. We're burning daylight."

#### 2.2 RESPIRATION HELMET
Your backup system when conduit fails.

**Required Enchantments:**
- Respiration III (extends breathing time)
- Aqua Affinity I (mining speed)
- Unbreaking III (durability)

**Stacking:**
- Respiration III + Turtle Shell = 70 seconds base
- Add water breathing potions = 8 minutes
- Add conduit = INFINITE

**Crew Rule:** Turtle shell is REQUIRED for all monument ops. No helmet, no dive.

#### 2.3 DEPTH STRIDER BOOTS
Speed matters when you're drowning.

**Enchantments:**
- Depth Strider III (normal walking speed)
- Frost Walker (ice path - frozen ocean ops)

**Pro Tip:** Dolphin's Grace potion effect stacks with Depth Strider III. Find a dolphin, let it lead you to treasure.

### NAVIGATION MARKING SYSTEMS

#### The Path Marker Protocol
1. **Torches** - Place on monument exterior every 20 blocks
   - Red torch = entrance
   - Yellow torch = sponge rooms
   - Green torch = treasure/core

2. **Glow Lichen** - Use for interior pathfinding
   - Place on left wall only (follow left wall rule)
   - Points toward exit

3. **Sea Pickles** - Emergency markers
   - White = danger/guardian room
   - Red = need air now
   - Place on ceiling for visibility

4. **Kelp** - Trail markers for return path
   - Plant every 15 blocks during transit
   - Can harvest later for fuel

## SECTION 3: OCEAN MONUMENTS - THE JOB SITE

### MONUMENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

#### 3.1 EXTERIOR LAYOUT
- **Size:** 58x58 blocks (largest structure in game)
- **Height:** From Y=23 to Y=57 (34 blocks tall)
- **Wall Material:** Prismarine, prismarine bricks, dark prismarine
- **Entry Points:** 3 main openings (top usually safest)

#### 3.2 INTERIOR ZONES

**Zone A: The Wing (Left and Right)**
- 2 large rooms per wing
- Contains: Sponge rooms (8 wet sponges each)
- Guardians: 2-3 per room
- **Crew Talk:** "Left wing's clear. Sponge room's full. Get the wagons."

**Zone B: The Core (Center)**
- 3 floors of rooms
- Bottom floor: Elder guardians (2x)
- Middle floor: Treasure (8 gold blocks)

- Contains: Final elder guardian
- Exit strategy: Build up, water elevator out

### MONUMENT MAPPING PROTOCOL

**Step 1: Perimeter Survey**
- Circle monument at Y=50 (mid-water)
- Count the wings (standard = 2)
- Mark all entrances
- **Crew Talk:** "Two wings, standard layout. East entrance clear. West's got guardians parked."

**Step 2: Exterior Sponge Scan**
- Look for wet sponge blocks on exterior walls
- Mark with sea pickle
- These indicate interior sponge room locations

**Step 3: Guardian Density Check**
- Count visible guardians
- 10+ = full monument (all elders active)
- 5-9 = partial clear
- 0-4 = pre-clear or failed raid

### ENTRY TACTICS

#### Option 1: The Top Drop (Preferred)
- Swim to roof level (Y=60)
- Break through center roof
- Drop into penthouse
- Clear elder first, work down

#### Option 2: The Front Door (Brave)
- Enter through main archway
- Prepare for 3+ guardian aggro immediately
- Fighting retreat to exterior

### FIGHTING PROTOCOLS

#### Phase 1: The Water Column Entry
**DO NOT** fight guardians in open water. You'll get swarmed.

**Correct Approach:**
1. Build a "kill box" - 3x3x3 enclosed space with glass walls
2. Place conduit inside
3. Poke guardians through glass (they can't hit back)
4. Lure them in with raw fish or squid

> **CREW TALK #2**
>
> **Combat Lead:** "We got guardians incoming. Three o'clock, distance 40. Everyone to the kill box!"
>
> **Rookie:** "I can take 'em in open water!"
>
> **Old Timer:** "You wanna fight three guardians at once? Kid, that's not bravery, that's stupidity. We use the box. We lure, we box, we slice. THAT'S how you come home with full health. Now get in the box before I make you swim back to shore!"

#### Phase 2: The Room Clear
Once inside monument:

1. **Corner Camp:** Find a corner, put your back to the wall
2. **Line of Sight:** Break line of sight when laser charging (hides behind blocks)
3. **Hit and Run:** Attack during laser recharge (2 second cooldown)
4. **Conduit Always:** Keep conduit active and in range

**Room Clear Sequence:**
1. Clear room guardians first (smaller threats)
2. Approach elder guardian (last)
3. Drink strength potion before elder fight
4. Kill elder within 3 minutes (or re-buff)

#### Phase 3: The Elder Encounter
**When Fighting Elders:**
- Mining Fatigue III makes mining IMPOSSIBLE
- Bring milk buckets to remove curse
- Time your attack: attack right after laser fires
- Circle strafe: don't stop moving

**Elder Kill Zones:**
- Corner trap (build 2-high walls, elder can't fit)
- Door trap (elder too big for doors)
- Surface breach (swim elder to surface, fight in air)

### COMBAT FORMATIONS

#### Single Operator
- Kill box method
- Conduit always within range
- Retreat to exterior if overwhelmed

#### Two-Person Team
- Person 1: Aggro holder (armor focus)
- Person 2: Damage dealer (weapon focus)
- Stay within 10 blocks of each other
- Cross-heal with regeneration arrows

#### Full Crew (3+)
- Designate combat specialists (2x)
- Designated looter (1x)
- Designated builder (1x) - constructs kill boxes
- Designated medic (1x) - healing potions, regeneration

## SECTION 5: SPONGE GATHERING - THE BIG PAYDAY

### SPONGE ECONOMICS

#### Why Sponges Matter
- **Primary Use:** Water removal for building projects
- **Secondary Use:** Decoration, yellow blocks
- **Market Value:** High demand for ocean construction
- **Monument Yield:** 128+ sponges per full monument

#### Sponge Types
1. **Wet Sponge** (harvested from monument)
   - Must be dried in furnace (smelting time: same as logs)
   - Stackable: 64
   - Cannot be used wet (must dry first)

2. **Dry Sponge** (smelted)
   - Absorbs water up to 4x4 area
   - Becomes wet after use
   - Reusable (re-dry)

### SPONGE ROOM LOCATION

#### Identifying Sponge Rooms
- **Exterior Signs:** Wet sponges visible on monument walls
- **Interior Signs:** Look for large, empty rooms with sponge blocks
- **Quantity:** 8 sponges per room (2 rooms per wing)

**Standard Monument Layout:**
```
           [Penthouse - Elder #3]
                    |
      [Left Wing] - [Core] - [Right Wing]
         |                    |
    [Sponge Room]        [Sponge Room]
      (8 sponges)          (8 sponges)
```

#### Advanced: Hidden Sponge Rooms
Some monuments have sponge rooms in the CORE, not wings.
- Look for unusual room sizes (larger than normal)
- Check every room systematically
- Use TNT to expose hidden rooms (dangerous but fast)

### GATHERING PROTOCOLS

#### Method 1: The Full Clear (Recommended)
1. Clear entire monument of guardians
2. Elder guardians dead = no mining fatigue
3. Harvest all sponges at leisure
4. **Time Investment:** 2-3 hours with full crew
5. **Yield:** 128+ sponges

#### Method 2: The Smash and Grab (High Risk)
1. Build conduit outside monument
2. Sprint to sponge rooms (ignore all else)
3. Use strength potion, fight through guardians
4. Grab sponges, RUN
5. **Time Investment:** 30 minutes
6. **Risk:** Death rate 40% (not recommended)

#### Method 3: The Tunnel Heist (Safe)
1. Dig tunnel under monument from outside
2. Come up under sponge rooms
3. Breach floor, grab sponges
4. No guardian combat (if done right)
5. **Time Investment:** 1 hour
6. **Yield:** 32 sponges (one wing only)

> **CREW TALK #3**
>
> **Loot Boss:** "Alright boys, sponge rooms are cleared. We got 128 wet sponges incoming!"
>
> **Hauler:** "That's... a lot of smelting, boss."
>
> **Loot Boss:** "We're not smelting here. Hauler, you got the wagons?"
>
> **Hauler:** "Four donkeys, all leather-armored."
>
> **Loot Boss:** "Good. We load the sponges, we haul to base, we set up 16 furnaces. Gang smelt. We sleep when the sponges are dry. This is the payday, boys. Tomorrow we start the reef construction. Tonight, we SMELT."

### DRYING OPERATIONS

#### Furnace Layout
- **Parallel Processing:** 8 furnaces minimum
- **Fuel Source:** Kelp blocks (dried kelp = smelting fuel)
- **Throughput:** 128 sponges / 10 minutes (with 8 furnaces)

**Drying Station Design:**
```
[Furnace][Furnace][Furnace][Furnace]
[Furnace][Furnace][Furnace][Furnace]
     [Chest: Input][Chest: Output]
```

#### Automated Drying (Advanced)
Use hoppers to auto-feed wet sponges, auto-pull dry sponges.
- Requires: 8 hoppers, 8 chests, 1 comparator
- **Throughput:** 1000+ sponges/hour unattended

## FINAL WORD FROM THE CREW CHIEF

You've read the manual. You know the protocols. Now get out there and prove it.

Ocean work separates the crew from the cargo. Down there, it's just you, your team, and the crushing dark. But with the right training, the right gear, and the right crew beside you, there's no treasure we can't reach.

Remember our rules:
1. **Trust your crew** - They're your lifeline
2. **Respect the ocean** - It'll kill the careless
3. **Plan the work** - Failing to plan is planning to drown
4. **Work the plan** - Stick to protocols, stay alive
5. **Come home** - No treasure is worth your life

Now grab your gear. The monuments aren't gonna clear themselves.

**CREW BOSS OUT**
