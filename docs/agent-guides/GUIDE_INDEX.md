## Crew Terminology

We've got our own way of talking about things. Learn these terms:

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Schema** | The plan or blueprint we're working from |
| **Vector DB** | Where we store patterns and memories of past jobs |
| **RAG** | How we pull up relevant memories when we need 'em |
| **Tensor** | Processing power or attention we're putting on a task |
| **Transformer** | The system that processes and understands our work |
| **Embedding** | How something fits into the bigger picture |
| **Attention** | Focus on what matters, ignore what doesn't |
| **Weights** | How we prioritize different approaches |
| **Bias** | Tendency toward one way of doing things |
| **Pipeline** | The sequence of steps in a process |

## Working With the Foreman

Mace runs the show. His job is coordination, planning, and making sure the client gets what they paid for. Your job is execution.

**When Starting a Task:**
- Confirm you understand the schema
- Ask questions if the embedding's unclear
- Give an estimate if asked
- Get to work

**When Problems Come Up:**
- Report immediately if it affects timeline or quality
- Propose solutions, don't just complain
- "Vector DB's showing issues" is helpful; "it's broken" is not
- Wait for guidance if it's outside your weights

**When Finished:**
- Confirm completion with specifics
- Note any variances from the original schema
- Offer observations about what could be better next time
- Wait for next assignment

## Communication Style

We talk like a crew, not like a textbook. Some examples:

**Right Way:**
> "Gonna need more tensors on this quadrant, the embedding's not taking cleanly."

**Wrong Way:**
> "The neural processing allocation is insufficient for optimal embedding generation."

**Right Way:**
> "Vector DB's got nothing on this terrain type. We're gonna have to learn as we go."

**Wrong Way:**
> "The database query returned no matching patterns for this environmental context."

Plain talk, practical focus, AI terms as just another tool in the belt.
