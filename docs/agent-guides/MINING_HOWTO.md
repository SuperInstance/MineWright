## The Basics

Mining's how we get what we need from the ground. Whether it's coal for fuel, diamonds for gear, or stone for building, the job's the same: get it out efficiently, safely, and in quantities that keep the operation running.

A good miner knows three things: WHERE to dig, HOW to dig, and WHEN to stop digging. Miss any of those and you're wasting time or worse.

---

## Tools of the Trade

**Required Equipment:**
- **Pickaxe** - Your main tool. Tier matters (see Tool Selection below)
- **Torches** - Light your work. Dark caves mean mobs, and mobs mean dead miners
- **Cobblestone** - For quick barriers, staircases, and plugging holes
- **Water Bucket** - Your best friend in an emergency. Turns lava to obsidian, saves lives
- **Food** - Mining burns energy. Keep yourself fueled
- **Chests** - Store findings. Don't make multiple trips - mine in loops

**Optional but Smart:**
- **Shovel** - For gravel and dirt layers. Faster than pickaxe
- **Signs/Slabs** - Mark explored areas, label chest contents
- **Ender Chests** - For long operations where you can't return to base
- **Compass** - If you're prone to getting turned around (no shame in it)
- **Clock** - Know when to surface before night falls

**What NOT to Bring:**
- Your best gear on the first trip. Start cheap, upgrade once you know the area
- Anything you can't afford to lose. You WILL fall in lava eventually

## Mining Strategies

### Branch Mining (The Standard)

Best for: Diamonds, ancient debris, systematic resource gathering

**How It Works:**
1. Dig to target Y-level (see Resource Location below)
2. Dig a main tunnel 2 blocks high, 1 block wide
3. Every 3 blocks, dig a branch tunnel left or right
4. Branches go 20-30 blocks deep or until you hit something
5. Continue pattern as long as needed

**Why 3-Block Spacing?**
- Ores appear in veins up to 2 blocks wide
- At 3-block spacing, you see every vein at least once
- At 2-block spacing, you see veins twice (wastes effort)
- At 4+ block spacing, you miss veins (wastes resources)

**Efficiency Tip:**
Mark your main tunnel with torches on the RIGHT side. When you're in a branch, torches on left = going out, torches on right = going to main. Simple, never get lost.

### Strip Mining

Best for: Large-scale resource gathering, clearing areas

**How It Works:**
1. Choose a starting level
2. Dig a long tunnel (2 high, 1 wide)
3. Dig another parallel tunnel 3 blocks away
4. Remove everything between the two tunnels
5. Repeat pattern

**When to Use:**
- You need LOT of stone/dirt
- Area is relatively safe (not too much lava)
- You have time to commit to a long operation

**Warning:**
Strip mining leaves holes. Fill them or mark them. Nothing ruins a foreman's day like falling into an unmarked strip mine during a building project.

### Cave Exploration

Best for: Exposed ores, adventure, faster than mining through stone

**How It Works:**
1. Find a cave entrance (or dig down to one)
2. Explore systematically, lighting everything
3. Follow cave branches, mine any visible ores
4. Place torches to mark explored areas
5. Wall off dangerous sections (lava, cliffs, mob spawners)

**The Loop Method:**
Always keep the wall on your RIGHT. This is the right-hand rule and it guarantees you'll explore every branch and find your way back out. Works in real caves too.

**Safety First:**
- NEVER explore a cave without at least 2 stacks of torches
- Listen for water/lava sounds before digging around corners
- Ceiling torches, floor torches, wall torches - light everywhere
- If you see a spawner, either disable it (break with pickaxe) or mark it and come back prepared

### Quarry Mining

Best for: Large volumes of stone, exposing multiple layers at once

**How It Works:**
1. Mark out a rectangular area on the surface
2. Dig out the entire area layer by layer
3. Each layer is 1-3 blocks deep
4. Continue until you hit bedrock or target depth
5. Use stairs or water elevator to get in and out

**Dimensions:**
- Small quarry: 8x8 to 16x16 blocks
- Medium quarry: 20x20 to 30x30 blocks
- Large quarry: 40x40+ (multiple workers recommended)

**Access:**
- Staircase along one edge (2 blocks wide, safe for up/down)
- Water elevator at corner (ride bubbles up, drop down with feather falling)
- Or both (stairs down, water up)

**Warning:**
Quarries attract mobs. Light the perimeter. Consider fencing it. Nothing says "inexperienced" like falling out of the sky and landing in your own quarry.

## Resource Location

### Ores by Y-Level (Minecraft 1.20+)

| Resource | Best Y-Level | Frequency | Vein Size | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Diamond** | Y -58 to -59 | Rare | 1-8 ores | Deepslate layer, below Y -50 |
| **Ancient Debris** | Y -58 to -59 | Very Rare | 1-3 ores | Nether only, use strip mining |
| **Gold** | Y -16 to -17 | Uncommon | 1-6 ores | Badlands: any Y, more common |
| **Iron** | Y 15 and Y 232 | Common | 1-6 ores | Two generations: deep and high |
| **Coal** | Y 0 to Y 96 | Very Common | 1-17 ores | Mountains: up to Y 136 |
| **Copper** | Y 48 to Y 49 | Common | 1-16 ores | Large veins, good for bulk |
| **Lapis** | Y 0 to Y 2 | Uncommon | 1-7 ores | Also blob at Y -64 to -56 |
| **Redstone** | Y -58 to -59 | Common | 1-12 ores | Very abundant at deep levels |
| **Emerald** | Y 232 to Y 236 | Rare | 1 ore | Mountains only, requires silk touch or fortune |

### Biome-Specific Resources

| Biome | Special Resources | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| **Badlands** | Gold, Terracotta | Gold at any Y-level |
| **Mountains** | Emeralds, Coal | Emeralds only here |
| **Swamp** | Blue Clay | Under water |
| **Snowy Biomes** | Packed Ice, Blue Ice | Needs silk touch |
| **Ocean** | Prismarine, Sea Lanterns | Underwater ruins |
| **Nether** | Netherite, Quartz, Glowstone | Different rules apply |

### Time vs. Yield Calculations

**Diamond Mining Efficiency:**
- Branch mining at Y -59: ~1 diamond per 3-5 minutes of mining
- Cave exploration: ~1 diamond per 10-15 minutes (but more fun)
- Strip mining at wrong levels: ~1 diamond per 30+ minutes (don't do this)

**Iron for Early Game:**
- Surface ravines: Fast iron, moderate danger
- Y 15 branch mine: Consistent iron, safe
- Mountains: Exposed iron, very fast if you find a good spot

## Tool Selection

### Pickaxe Tiers

| Tier | Material | Speed | Durability | Mining Level | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Wood** | Slow | 59 | Stone/Cobble | First pick only, upgrade immediately |
| 2 | **Stone** | Medium | 131 | Iron/Gold | Early game, disposable mining |
| 3 | **Iron** | Fast | 250 | Redstone/Diamond | Standard workhorse |
| 4 | **Gold** | Very Fast | 32 | N/A | Speed runs only, breaks too fast |
| 5 | **Diamond** | Very Fast | 1561 | Obsidian | Long operations, worth the investment |
| 6 | **Netherite** | Fastest | 2031 | Everything | End game, survival situations |

### Enchantment Priorities

**Must-Have Enchantments:**
1. **Efficiency V** - Mines significantly faster. Pay off time: ~2-3 hours of mining
2. **Unbreaking III** - Tool lasts 3x longer. Mandatory for diamond/netherite
3. **Mending** - Repairs using XP. Makes tools effectively infinite. Get this ASAP

**Situational Enchantments:**
- **Fortune III** - Get more from coal, diamonds, redstone, lapis. Use on dedicated mining pick
- **Silk Touch** - Pick up blocks instead of resources. For spawners, glass, ice, ender chests
- **Sharpness/Smite** - Combat pick. Keep one in hotbar for mobs

**Enchantment Strategy:**
- Early game: Unbreaking I or II on iron pick
- Mid game: Fortune III on diamond pick (your mining workhorse)
- Late game: Efficiency V, Unbreaking III, Mending on netherite pick (never switch again)

### Which Pick for Which Job?

**Routine Mining (Stone, Dirt, Gravel):**
- Stone pick with Unbreaking
- Disposable, fast enough, doesn't matter if it breaks

**Resource Mining (Diamonds, Redstone, Lapis):**
- Diamond pick with Fortune III
- Maximizes yield from every ore
- Worth the enchantment investment

**Heavy Operations (Quarries, Long Branch Mines):**
- Netherite pick with Efficiency V, Unbreaking III, Mending
- One tool does the whole job
- More efficient than carrying multiple picks

**Special Operations (Spawners, Glass, Ice):**
- Diamond pick with Silk Touch
- Dedicated tool, don't use for regular mining
- Mark it so you don't accidentally waste it

---

## Safety Protocols

### Lava Safety

**Rule #1: Assume lava is everywhere.**

**Detection:**
- Listen for the bubbling sound before you see it
- Watch for falling particles (lava's above)
- Check your F3 debug screen - lava pools show as air blocks nearby
- When in doubt, dig UP before digging FORWARD

**Emergency Response:**
1. **STOP moving immediately** - Don't run into it
2. **Place water** - Click on the block NEXT to lava, flow water over it
3. **Retrieve water** - Pick up the water source before it flows everywhere
4. **Assess** - Now that it's obsidian/cobble, decide how to proceed

**Lava in Cave:**
- Place cobble to contain it
- Use gravel/sand to fill from above (safer than standing next to it)
- If you can't contain it, mark the area and report to foreman

**Fell in Lava:**
1. **Don't panic** - Easier said than done, but panic kills
2. **Use water bucket** - Place water under yourself immediately
3. **Get out** - Now that it's obsidian, climb out
4. **Retrieve items if possible** - Sometimes you can grab stuff before it burns
5. **Report the incident** - Foreman needs to know about lava pockets

### Mob Awareness

**Hostile Mobs in Caves:**
- **Zombies** - Slow, easy to kill, but come in numbers
- **Skeletons** - Ranged, dangerous in narrow tunnels. Use shield or close distance
- **Spiders** - Can climb walls, fit through 1-block gaps
- **Cave Spiders** - Poisonous, small, come from spawners
- **Creepers** - THE DANGER. One explosion ruins your day. Listen for the hiss

**Mob Prevention:**
- **Light everything** - Torches every 8-10 blocks, no dark corners
- **Place doors strategically** - Zombies can't break iron doors
- **Use fences** - 1.5 blocks high, spiders can't climb over
- **Listen** - You hear mobs before you see them. That hissing sound? RUN.

**Combat in Tunnels:**
- **Knockback is king** - Sword with Knockback II keeps distance
- **Block with shield** - Especially against skeletons
- **Retreat to open space** - Narrow tunnels favor mobs, not you
- **Never fight multiple mobs at once** - Back up, separate them, fight one at a time

### Torch Placement Patterns

**The Torch Trail:**
- Place torches on ONE side of the tunnel only (right side works best)
- When returning, torches should be on your LEFT
- If torches are on right, you're going deeper, not out
- Simple, foolproof, saves lives

**Lighting Level:**
- Torch prevents mob spawns in 7-block radius
- Place torches every 6-8 blocks for complete coverage
- In caves, torch EVERY visible dark spot
- Ceilings, floors, walls - mobs spawn on any surface

**Information Torches:**
- Leave patterns to mark special areas:
  - **Two torches side-by-side** - Something interesting/mined out
  - **Three torches in triangle** - Danger area (lava, ravine, etc.)
  - **Torch with cobble below** - Loot chest or special resource
  - **Torch with sign** - Always best, but takes time

### When to Abort

**Stop Mining If:**
- Your tool is at <10% durability and you're far from base
- You're at 3 hearts or less and mobs are nearby
- You've been mining for 2+ hours (fatigue = mistakes)
- You're carrying more than you can afford to lose
- You don't know which way is out

**The Too Greedy Rule:**
Every time you say "just one more branch," you're tempting fate. Set a limit before you start (3 stacks of cobble, 6 branches, etc.) and STOP when you hit it. Nothing says amateur like dying with a full inventory because you wanted "just one more."

---

## Efficiency Tips

### Optimal Tunnel Spacing

**Branch Mining Math:**
- Ore veins: up to 2 blocks wide
- Max sight distance: 1 block each side = 4 blocks total
- Center-to-center spacing: 3 blocks = see every vein once
- Center-to-center spacing: 2 blocks = see every vein twice (waste)
- Center-to-center spacing: 4 blocks = miss some veins (inefficient)

**Conclusion: 3-block spacing is optimal.**
No exceptions, no "just this once," no creative alternatives. 3 blocks.

### Fortune Usage

**When to Use Fortune:**
- **Diamonds** - Fortune III gives +120% average yield (1 ore → 2.2 diamonds)
- **Redstone** - Fortune III gives massive bonus (1 ore → 4-6 redstone)
- **Lapis** - Fortune III gives +80% average yield
- **Coal** - Fortune I or II sufficient, not worth high-level enchantment
- **Emeralds** - Silk Touch needed or you get 1 XP only

**When NOT to Use Fortune:**
- **Iron/Gold** - Fortune does nothing. Mine normally.
- **Nether Quartz** - Fortune doesn't apply
- **Glowstone** - Fortune increases yield but Silk Touch might be better

**Fortune Stacking Trick:**
- Mine ore with Fortune III pick
- If you get 1 diamond, mine the EXPOSED ore again (not the dropped item)
- Game recalculates fortune each time you mine the exposed ore
- Can get 2-4 diamonds from a single ore (advanced technique)

### Inventory Management

**The Loop System:**
1. **Full inventory?** Time to head back, not time to throw stuff away
2. **Hotbar organization:**
   - Slot 1: Pickaxe (main tool)
   - Slot 2: Shovel (for gravel)
   - Slot 3: Torch
   - Slot 4: Water bucket (emergency)
   - Slot 5: Cobblestone (barriers)
   - Slot 6: Food
   - Slot 7: Sword (combat)
   - Slot 8-9: Flex slots (signs, special items)
   - Slot 0 (offhand): Shield or empty
3. **Inventory sorting:**
   - Top rows: Valuable items (diamonds, iron, gold)
   - Middle rows: Common resources (coal, redstone, stone)
   - Bottom rows: Junk (dirt, gravel, cobble)

**When to Dump:**
- Inventory full: Always dump valuable items first
- Cobblestone: Only keep if you need it for building
- Dirt/Gravel: Almost never worth keeping
- Netherrack: Keep only if making nether brick

**Chest Strategy:**
- Place a chest at your mining base
- Before heading out, empty everything except tools
- When you return, sort items into the chest
- Next trip, grab what you need and go
- Reduces trips, reduces risk, increases efficiency

### Speed Techniques

**Mining Speed Optimization:**
- **Efficiency V** = 2.5x mining speed. Mandatory for serious mining.
- **Haste II beacon** = +40% mining speed. Set up near mining operation.
- **Mining fatigue** = AVOID at all costs. Makes even wooden picks seem fast.
- **Always look forward** - Mining sideways is slower due to player position.

**Movement Optimization:**
- **Sprint mining** - Sprint and mine in rhythm. Maintains forward momentum.
- **Jump mining** - Slightly faster for 2-high tunnels, uses more hunger.
- **No-backtrack paths** - Plan your route to end at your exit point.
- **Water elevators** - Fastest way to go up instantly.

**Tool Switching:**
- **Use stone picks for dirt/gravel** - Faster than shovel, disposable.
- **Switch to diamond for ores** - Don't waste durability on stone.
- **Keep multiple tools** - Switching is faster than waiting.

## Advanced Techniques

### Fortune Stripping

**The Technique:**
1. Find an ore vein with standard pick
2. Switch to Fortune III pick
3. Mine each ore block individually
4. Collect maximum yield
5. Use standard pick to clear remaining stone

**When to Use:**
- Diamond veins (critical for maximizing yield)
- Redstone veins (high bonus from fortune)
- Lapis veins (moderate bonus)

**Why It Works:**
Fortune applies per-block mining. Using it on every ore in a vein maximizes total yield from that vein. Standard pick for stone saves enchantment durability.

### Silk Touch Applications

**Why Use Silk Touch:**
- **Ore blocks** - Mine ore, place elsewhere, mine with fortune later
- **Spawners** - Pick up mob spawners, move to better location
- **Glass** - Pick up glass without breaking
- **Ice** - Pick up ice, place in nether for water farms
- **Endstone** - Pick up end stone, move to overworld for building
- **Coral** - Pick up live coral, place on land

**Silk Touch Strategy:**
- Use Silk Touch pick to MINE ores
- Place ores in safe location
- Switch to Fortune III pick
- Mine placed ores for maximum yield
- Works because ore blocks remember their type

**Advanced: Double Fortune Trick:**
1. Find diamond ore
2. Mine with Silk Touch (get diamond ore block)
3. Place in safe location
4. Mine with Fortune III (get 1-4 diamonds)
5. If result was 1 diamond, place another Silk Touch ore
6. Try again with Fortune III
7. Repeat until satisfied with yield

### Beacon Usage

**Beacon Setup for Mining:**
1. **Pyramid base** - 9x9, 7x7, 5x5, 3x3 (mineral blocks: iron/gold/diamond/emerald)
2. **Beacon placed** - On top of pyramid
3. **Haste II** - Selected as primary power
4. **Mining Speed** - +40% increase

**Cost Calculation:**
- Level 1 beacon: 81 mineral blocks (base)
- Level 2 beacon: +49 blocks (130 total)
- Level 3 beacon: +49 blocks (179 total)
- Level 4 beacon: +49 blocks (228 total)

**Iron blocks recommended:**
- Iron is abundant (branch mine at Y 15)
- Much cheaper than gold/diamond/emerald
- Same effect regardless of mineral type

**Beacon Placement:**
- Center of mining operation
- Line of sight to working area
- Protection from accidental destruction
- Consider adding regeneration if mobs are common

**Is It Worth It?**
- Large operations (10+ hours mining): YES
- Small operations (1-2 hours): Probably not
- Team operations: DEFINITELY (benefits everyone)

### TNT Mining

**When to Use TNT:**
- Large-scale excavation
- Clearing huge areas quickly
- Nether mining (ancient debris)
- Resource stripping (clearing stone to expose ores)

**TNT Efficiency Math:**
- 1 TNT = clears 3x3x3 area (27 blocks)
- 1 gunpowder + 4 sand = 1 TNT
- 1 TNT destroys 75% of blocks (25% drop as items)
- For stone: mostly destroyed (good for clearing)
- For ores: risk of destruction (BAD for diamonds)

**Safe TNT Mining:**
1. **Dig tunnel** - 2 high, 1 wide
2. **Place TNT** - Every 3 blocks in tunnel
3. **Redstone trail** - Connect all TNT
4. **Retreat to safe distance** - At least 20 blocks away
5. **Ignite with redstone** - NOT flint and steel (safer)
6. **Wait for explosions** - All TNT triggers almost instantly
7. **Return and collect** - Any exposed ores are yours

**TNT in the Nether:**
- Ancient debris is blast-resistant (survives TNT)
- Surrounding netherrack is destroyed (clears area)
- Strip mining with TNT: place TNT in line, detonate, reveal debris
- Much faster than traditional nether mining

**Warning:**
- TNT destroys items. Don't use if you want the drops.
- TNT triggers other TNT. Chain reactions are dangerous.
- TNT in water doesn't destroy blocks. Use this to control explosions.

---

## Team Coordination

### Parallel Mining

**When to Split Up:**
- Area is large enough for multiple operations
- Each miner has clear objectives
- Communication is established
- Safety protocols are in place

**Parallel Strategies:**
1. **Grid Division** - Divide area into sections, each miner claims a section
2. **Depth Separation** - One miner at Y 15 (iron), one at Y -59 (diamonds)
3. **Task Specialization** - One miner clears stone, one mines ores
4. **Branch Opposition** - Two miners branch mine in opposite directions

**Communication Requirements:**
- **Start check-in** - Confirm everyone's objective before starting
- **Progress updates** - Every 10-15 minutes, report findings
- **Hazard alerts** - Immediately report lava, ravines, mob spawners
- **Completion signal** - When done or returning to base, let team know

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't mine toward each other without coordinating
- Don't block shared tunnels
- Don't consume resources others need (torches, food, tools)
- Don't abandon team members without confirmation

### Multi-Level Operations

**Vertical Coordination:**
- Upper level (Y 15): Iron, coal, general resources
- Middle level (Y -50): Redstone, lapis, gold
- Lower level (Y -59): Diamonds, ancient debris

**Staircase Placement:**
- Central staircase connects all levels
- Mark each level entrance clearly
- Light staircase thoroughly (common mob spawn point)
- Water elevator optional (faster travel between levels)

**Resource Sharing:**
- Ore types found on wrong level? Report to appropriate level
- Extra tools/food? Share with team
- Found a good spot? Mark it for others

### Team Safety

**Watch Each Other's Six:**
- **Behind check** - Before moving forward, check behind for mobs
- **Torch relay** - If you see teammate in darkness, toss them a torch
- **Emergency response** - If someone dies, retrieve their items if safe
- **No lone wolves** - Everyone checks out, everyone returns

**Emergency Signals:**
- **Repeated jumping** - Need help immediately
- **Torch spam** - Placing torches rapidly = found something important
- **Three torches** - Danger, avoid this area
- **Empty hotbar** - Out of supplies, need resupply

**Team Composition:**
- **3-4 miners** - Optimal for most operations
- **1 foreman** - Coordinates, solves problems, keeps everyone safe
- **1 support** - Runs supplies, manages chests, handles logistics
- Total: 5-6 people maximum for coordinated operations

## Error Recovery

### When You're Lost

**The Navigation Rule:**
- If you don't know which way is out, STOP
- Don't panic-mine (you'll make it worse)
- Don't dig randomly (you'll hit lava eventually)
- Use systematic methods

**Finding Your Way:**
1. **Use F3 debug screen** - Shows your direction and coordinates
2. **Look for your torch pattern** - If you placed torches on right, follow the rule
3. **Follow the ceiling** - Often leads back to your main tunnel
4. **Place cobble markers** - As you search, mark where you've been
5. **Dig UP carefully** - Surface is always above (but watch for gravel/sand)

**The Reset Method:**
1. **Dig to Y 60** - Sea level, consistent reference
2. **Dig straight up** - With torches below you
3. **Surface** - See where you are, recalculate
4. **Return** - Come back with better navigation

**Last Resort:**
- If you have a compass, use it
- If you have coordinates of base, calculate direction
- If truly lost and desperate, dig UP to surface (risky but reliable)

### When You're Trapped

**Common Traps:**
- **Gravel/sand collapse** - Dug under gravel, it buried you
- **Water flow** - Dug into water, can't swim up
- **Lava nearby** - Lava cut off your exit
- **Dead end** - Dug into a pocket with no way out

**Gravel/Sand Collapse:**
1. **Don't panic** - You have 10 seconds of air
2. **Dig diagonally UP** - Not straight up (more gravel falls)
3. **Place torch** - Under gravel to break it
4. **Mine up** - Once gravel is broken, continue to surface

**Water Flow Trap:**
1. **Place blocks** - To stop water flow
2. **Swim up** - Once water is contained
3. **Use bucket** - If you have one, remove water source
4. **Dig around** - Find alternative exit

**Lava Trap:**
1. **Don't approach** - Lava kills faster than you think
2. **Use water** - Turn lava to obsidian
3. **Create bridge** - Place cobble over obsidian
4. **Escape** - Back the way you came, mark area for later

### When You Died

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Respawn quickly** - Items despawn after 5 minutes
2. **Mark death location** - If you remember coordinates
3. **Return with gear** - Pickaxe, torches, weapons
4. **Retrieve items** - Before they despawn

**If You Don't Remember Location:**
1. **Retrace your path** - Follow your torch markers back
2. **Search systematically** - Check all branches you explored
3. **Ask teammates** - If mining with others, they might know
4. **Accept loss** - If 5 minutes passed, items are gone

**Preventing Death Loss:**
- **Keep a death chest mod** - If allowed by server
- **Store valuable items** - Don't carry everything at once
- **Mark your path** - Torches, signs, cobble markers
- **Play cautiously** - Better slow than dead

### When Tools Break

**Tool Breaks Mid-Mining:**
1. **Assess situation** - Are you safe? Can you return safely?
2. **Check inventory** - Any backup tools? Even low-tier?
3. **Use hands if desperate** - Takes 3x longer, but works for stone/dirt
4. **Call for help** - If on team, someone can bring you a tool

**Prevention:**
- **Monitor durability** - Check tool durability every 5-10 minutes
- **Carry backup** - Even a stone pick is better than nothing
- **Enchant Unbreaking** - Triples tool life
- **Mending** - Makes tools effectively infinite with XP

**Tool Calculation:**
- Diamond pick durability: 1561 uses
- At 10 uses per minute: ~2.5 hours of mining
- With Unbreaking III: ~7.5 hours of mining
- With Mending: Infinite as long as you get XP occasionally

## Communication with Foreman

### What to Report

**Always Report:**
- **Lava pockets** - Location, size, accessibility
- **Ravines** - Position, depth, resources visible
- **Diamond findings** - Coordinates, quantity, if more might be nearby
- **Mob spawners** - Location, type, if disabled
- **Terrain changes** - Biome shifts, underground features
- **Tool status** - Durability below 20%, need replacement
- **Full inventory** - Ready to return, or need chest placement

**Report If:**
- You found something unusual (structures, strongholds, portals)
- You're running low on supplies (torches, food, wood)
- You encountered other players' mining operations
- You died and need to retrieve items
- You're stuck or lost (communication is faster than random searching)

**Don't Report:**
- Every single ore (common resources don't need updates)
- Minor setbacks (small lava pools you handled yourself)
- Routine progress (foreman knows you're mining, that's the job)
- Personal observations unless they affect the operation

### How to Report

**Report Format:**
1. **Your name/role** - "Dusty here"
2. **Location** - Coordinates or direction from base
3. **What happened** - Clear, factual description
4. **What you need** - If anything (help, supplies, guidance)

**Example Good Reports:**
```
"Dusty here. Located at X -250, Y -59, Z 1200. Found diamond vein,
15 blocks from main branch. Mining out now, estimate 5 minutes.
Continuing branch operation after."

"Rocks reporting. Hit ravine at X -300, Y -30, Z 1150. Runs east-west,
about 40 blocks visible. Coal and iron exposed on south wall.
Requesting guidance on crossing or marking as hazard."

"Sparks checking in. Tool at 12% durability, inventory full.
Located at main tunnel branch 7. Returning to base to drop off
and resupply. ETA 3 minutes."
```

**Example Bad Reports:**
```
"Found stuff." (Too vague, foreman can't use this information)

"I'm mining." (No new information, waste of communication)

"Something happened but it's probably fine." (Vague, foreman will
ask for clarification anyway)

"Help." (No context, foreman doesn't know what's happening)
```

### Timing of Reports

**Immediate Reports:**
- Life-threatening situations (lava burst, mob swarm)
- Major discoveries (diamonds, structures, other players)
- Problems affecting timeline (tool broke, lost, stuck)

**Routine Reports:**
- Every 15-30 minutes during operations
- When returning to base
- When starting a new section
- When completing objective

**End-of-Operation Report:**
- Time spent mining
- Resources collected (by type and quantity)
- Notable findings
- Problems encountered
- Recommendations for future operations

---

## Crew Talk

### Dialogue 1: Morning Briefing

**Foreman:** "Alright crew, listen up. Today's a mining day. We need diamonds, iron, and coal. Dusty, you're on branch mining at Y -59. Rocks, strip mining at Y 15 for iron. Sparks, you're running supplies and managing the base. Questions?"

**Dusty:** "What's the diamond target, boss?"

**Foreman:** "Minimum two stacks. If you don't find that in two hours, we reassess. But knowing the deep layer, you'll hit quota easy."

**Rocks:** "How much iron we talking?"

**Foreman:** "Everything you can carry. We're building storage next week, need materials. I want you filling chests until I call you off."

**Sparks:** "Supply schedule?"

**Foreman:** "Check-ins every 20 minutes. Dusty, when you hit half inventory, Sparks brings a chest. Rocks, same. Nobody stops for full inventory - we keep the flow going."

**Dusty:** "Tools?"

**Foreman:** "Dusty, you get the Fortune III diamond pick. Make it count. Rocks, standard iron pick with Unbreaking. Keep me updated on durability. Any tool breaks, report immediately."

**Rocks:** "Lava protocol?"

**Foreman:** "Standard. Water bucket in hotbar 4. If you can't handle it, mark and report. Don't be heroes - lava kills heroes. I want you coming back with full inventories, not as respawned ghosts."

**Sparks:** "Mob situation?"

**Foreman:** "Torches, lots of them. Light everything. If you find a spawner, mark it and I'll disable it myself. Nobody fights spawners solo. Clear?"

**All:** "Clear."

**Foreman:** "Good. Let's get after it. Remember: measure twice, dig once. And don't die. That's an order."

### Dialogue 2: Mid-Mining Progress Update

**Foreman:** "Status check. Dusty, you first."

**Dusty:** "Branch 12 complete. Found six diamonds in two veins, two stacks of redstone, one stack lapis. Tool at 85% durability. No lava, no mobs. Starting branch 13."

**Foreman:** "Six diamonds already? You're ahead of schedule. Keep that rhythm."

**Dusty:** "Deep layer's treating me good. Got a nice system going. Three-block spacing, torches on right, never lost."

**Rocks:** "You and your precious spacing. Some of us work in the real world where stone doesn't line up perfect."

**Dusty:** "Real world? You're digging in a strip mine. The only thing lined up is your tan."

**Foreman:** "Save the comedy for the break. Rocks, status."

**Rocks:** "Strip mine level 3 complete. Four stacks iron, eight stacks coal, three stacks cobble. Hit a gravel pocket, slowed me down some. Tool at 60%. Found a cave entrance, didn't explore yet."

**Foreman:** "Good iron haul. Mark the cave entrance with three torches. I'll check it when I rotate through. Don't explore solo - caves have more than just ores."

**Rocks:** "Copy that. Cave marked. Continuing strip."

**Sparks:** "Supply run incoming to Dusty. ETA 2 minutes. Bringing chest, food refill, extra torches."

**Dusty:** "Appreciated. Half inventory anyway. Perfect timing."

**Foreman:** "Sparks, after Dusty drop, check on Rocks. He's at 60% tool, might need replacement soon."

**Sparks:** "On it. Bringing backup iron pick just in case."

**Foreman:** "Good look-ahead. Keep it up, everyone. Two hours in, excellent progress. Dusty, another branch and you're at quota. Rocks, keep stripping. Sparks, keep the flow moving. Let's finish strong."

### Dialogue 3: Lava Emergency

**Dusty:** "BOSS. Lava. NOW."

**Foreman:** "Location?"

**Dusty:** "Branch 18, X -347, Y -59, Z 1247. Lava pool, medium size. I contained it with cobble but it's bigger than I can handle safely."

**Foreman:** "You hurt?"

**Dusty:** "No. Had water bucket ready. Reacted fast. But this pool is big, boss. And I think there's more behind it."

**Foreman:** "Stay put. Don't go deeper. I'm coming down. Rocks, you in charge of surface until I get back."

**Rocks:** "Copy. Hold the fort, keep mining. Be safe down there."

**Foreman:** "Always. ETA 3 minutes. Dusty, sit tight. Don't be a hero."

**Dusty:** "Waiting at branch entrance. Torch pattern's good, I know where I am. Just waiting on you."

[Three minutes later, sound of footsteps]

**Foreman:** "I see your torch markers. Good work. Branch 18?"

**Dusty:** "This one. Follow me, stay close. Lava's just ahead."

**Foreman:** "Show me."

[Sound of mining, then bubbling]

**Foreman:** "That's a medium pool, alright. Good containment work. You said there's more?"

**Dusty:** "Listen."

[Sound of more lava bubbling]

**Foreman:** "That's not one pool. That's connected pools. Undermined the whole area."

**Dusty:** "My thought exactly. I was about to dig into that main chamber when I saw the flow through the wall. Stopped immediately."

**Foreman:** "Good instinct. This would've flooded your branch, maybe the whole main tunnel. You just saved us hours of cleanup."

**Dusty:** "Just doing what you taught me. Listen for the bubbles, watch for the particles."

**Foreman:** "And you remembered. That's the difference between a miner and a corpse. Here's what we're gonna do: wall off this entire section. Mark it as hazardous. We'll come back later with proper drainage planning."

**Dusty:** "Can we still mine the other branches?"

**Foreman:** "Other side of the main tunnel, yes. This side's done for today. Good news: you hit quota anyway. Six diamonds is enough."

**Dusty:** "But we could've gotten more if I hadn't hit this lava."

**Foreman:** "And if you'd gone through that wall, you'd be dead and we'd have zero diamonds. Some losses are acceptable. Dead miners aren't. Let's wall this off and head back."

**Dusty:** "Copy that. Cobble the entrance?"

**Foreman:** "Cobble the entrance, put three torches for hazard marking. Let's go home."

### Dialogue 4: Tool Break and Recovery

**Rocks:** "Boss. We have a situation."

**Foreman:** "Go."

**Rocks:** "Tool broke. Iron pick, at 2% durability, I pushed it one block too far. It's gone. I'm at strip mine level 5, X -200, Y 15, Z 1100. Half inventory of iron, nowhere to put it."

**Foreman:** "You hurt?"

**Rocks:** "No. Just stuck with a full inventory and no tool. Can't even dig my way out efficiently."

**Foreman:** "Sparks, your location?"

**Sparks:** "Base. Stocked on tools. I have a spare iron pick with Unbreaking, plus a stone pick backup."

**Foreman:** "Grab both. Get to Rocks. Coordinates are X -200, Y 15, Z 1100. Stay on the surface, mark the entrance clearly. Rocks, sit tight. Don't try to dig out with hands."

**Rocks:** "Wasn't planning to. I've got enough cobble to build a chair while I wait. Not my first rodeo."

**Foreman:** "Good attitude. Sparks, ETA?"

**Sparks:** "Running now. Taking the direct route. Should be there in under 2 minutes. Bringing torches too, in case he needs to mark a path back."

**Rocks:** "You're a lifesaver, Sparks. When I get back, first round's on me."

**Sparks:** "Don't promise what you can't deliver. I drink expensive."

**Foreman:** "Focus, team. Rocks, when Sparks gets there, swap tools, dump your inventory in the chest he's bringing, and return to base. We're done for the day anyway."

**Rocks:** "Copy that. Nice haul of iron though. Six stacks, plus three coal. Worth the broken tool."

**Foreman:** "Tools are replaceable. You're not. But for future reference: when a tool hits 10%, you switch it. Don't push to 2%. That's how we end up in this situation."

**Rocks:** "Understood. Won't happen again."

**Foreman:** "See that it doesn't. Sparks, confirm delivery."

**Sparks:** "Tool delivered. Rocks is switching now. Chest placed, inventory transferring. We're heading back."

**Foreman:** "Good work, both of you. Debrief at base in 10. Dusty, you keep mining until I get back, then we're done."

**Dusty:** "Copy. One more branch, coming up."

### Dialogue 5: End of Day Debrief

**Foreman:** "Alright everyone, gather 'round. Let's talk about today."

**Dusty:** "Sixteen diamonds. Four stacks redstone. Two stacks lapis. Eight stacks coal. Tool at 70%."

**Rocks:** "Six stacks iron. Five stacks coal. Two stacks cobble. Tool broke, but Sparks handled it."

**Sparks:** "Successfully delivered emergency tool to Rocks, managed chest transfers, kept supply lines open. Transported three chests total. No issues."

**Foreman:** "Overall? Excellent work. Dusty, you exceeded diamond quota by 700%. That's not a typo. I expected two stacks, you brought four. Outstanding."

**Dusty:** "Deep layer was good to me. Plus, I used the three-block spacing exactly like you taught us. Didn't miss a vein."

**Foreman:** "And it shows. That's why we follow protocols, people. Rocks, iron haul is solid. You moved a lot of material for one day. Tool break was preventable, but you handled it right by reporting immediately."

**Rocks:** "Lesson learned on the durability check. But I'll be more careful next time."

**Foreman:** "See that you are. Sparks, supply logistics were flawless. You kept everyone equipped, handled the emergency tool delivery, and managed all chest transfers. That's the unsung work that makes operations run smooth."

**Sparks:** "Just doing my job, boss. But I'll take the compliment."

**Foreman:** "We hit all objectives. Diamonds, iron, coal - we're stocked for a month. Tomorrow we build storage. Rest up tonight, you earned it. Any final thoughts?"

**Dusty:** "That lava pocket in branch 18 - we going back for it?"

**Foreman:** "Eventually. But not tomorrow. We need to plan a proper drainage operation. Some jobs are worth taking time on. Lava's one of them."

**Rocks:** "And the cave I found?"

**Foreman:** "I'll scout it tomorrow morning. If it's good, we'll do a team cave run later this week. Safety in numbers."

**Sparks:** "Tomorrow's building operation - need me to prep anything tonight?"

**Foreman:** "Restock torches, sharpen tools, organize chests. Standard prep. Nothing special needed."

**Foreman:** "Anything else? No? Then we're done. Great work today, everyone. This is why you're the best crew I've ever led. See you at dawn."

**All:** "See you then, boss."

### Dialogue 6: The "Just One More" Syndrome

**Dusty:** "Foreman, I'm at quota. Sixteen diamonds in the chest. But... I see another branch here that looks promising."

**Foreman:** "Dusty, you know what I'm going to say."

**Dusty:** "I know, I know. 'Just one more' is how miners die. But seriously, this spot has all the signs. Right Y-level, good spacing, I haven't found a diamond in two branches which means I'm due."

**Rocks:** "That's not how probability works and you know it."

**Dusty:** "Stay out of this, Mr. Strip-Mine-Until-You-Pass-Out."

**Foreman:** "Rocks has a point. But Dusty, I get it. The call of the deep. It's real. But here's the thing: you're ahead of quota. Way ahead. There's no shame in quitting while you're ahead."

**Dusty:** "But what if the next branch has FIVE diamonds? What if I'm walking away from the motherlode?"

**Foreman:** "Then you walk away from it. Diamonds respawn. Dead miners don't. I've buried too many 'just one more' miners. Don't become another one."

**Dusty:** "That's dark, boss."

**Foreman:** "It's reality. Our work is dangerous. Lava, mobs, cave-ins - any one of them can end you. We manage risk, we don't eliminate it. And managing risk means knowing when to quit."

**Sparks:** "Plus, you've been down there four hours. Fatigue leads to mistakes. Mistakes lead to dead miners."

**Dusty:** "So everyone's against me?"

**Foreman:** "Everyone's trying to keep you alive. If that's 'against you' in your book, then yes. But in my book, that's called having a crew that cares."

**Dusty:** "Fair enough. I'm coming up. But I'm marking that branch. Next operation, I'm starting there."

**Foreman:** "Deal. Mark it, head up, we'll debrief. And Dusty? Thanks for listening. Some miners don't."

**Dusty:** "I want to live to mine another day. And to get back at Rocks for calling me out on probability."

**Rocks:** "You're welcome for the save."

**Dusty:** "You're just jealous of my diamond haul."

**Rocks:** "Sixteen diamonds is impressive. But you know what's more impressive? Being alive to enjoy them."

**Foreman:** "Both of you, knock it off. Dusty, get up here. We're done."

### Dialogue 7: Team Cave Exploration

**Foreman:** "Listen up. Rocks found a cave system. Big one. Multiple branches, visible ores, waterfalls. We're going in as a team."

**Dusty:** "What's the protocol?"

**Foreman:** "Standard cave exploration with team modifications. I take point. Dusty, you're rear guard. Rocks, you're middle. Sparks, you stay at entrance, manage chests, call out if anything comes from behind."

**Sparks:** "Copy. Setting up base camp at entrance."

**Foreman:** "Rules: nobody goes off alone. If you see a branch, wait for everyone. If you see ores, mark them and keep moving. We'll mine on the way back. Light everything. Weapons ready. Questions?"

**Rocks:** "Mob spawners?"

**Foreman:** "I'll disable. If you see one, call out. Don't engage alone. Especially cave spiders - they're nasty in groups."

**Dusty:** "Waterfalls?"

**Foreman:** "We follow them. Usually lead to more cave. But carefully - water means mobs can flow too. We'll check each waterfall before descending."

**Sparks:** "If I see mobs spawning at entrance?"

**Foreman:** "Light it up like it's daytime. Place torches every 5 blocks. If they keep coming, fall back to base and we'll abort."

**Foreman:** "Everyone ready?"

**All:** "Ready."

**Foreman:** "Let's move. Eyes open, weapons ready, stay together. We explore, we mark, we return. Then we mine. Clear?"

**All:** "Clear."

[Sound of footsteps, torches being placed]

**Dusty:** "Hey boss, coal on left ceiling. Ten blocks."

**Foreman:** "Mark it with torch. Keep moving. We'll get it on the way back."

**Rocks:** "Iron vein on right. Five blocks. Should we... wait, I hear something."

**Foreman:** "Hold. Everyone stop."

[Sound of zombie groaning]

**Foreman:** "One zombie ahead. I'll engage. Rocks, watch our backs. Dusty, flank left."

**Combat sounds, then silence]

**Foreman:** "Clear. Experience dropped. Keep moving."

**Rocks:** "That was smooth."

**Foreman:** "That's why we work as a team. Alone, that zombie could've pushed you into a pit. Together, it's a free XP drop. Eyes forward, moving out."

**Dusty:** "Lava ahead. Small pool. I can see... gold? That's gold in the lava wall."

**Foreman:** "Mark the location. We'll drain it on the way back. Don't approach lava without a plan."

**Sparks (from distance):** "Boss, skeleton at entrance. Took it out. Just heads up."

**Foreman:** "Copy. Good work, Sparks. Status check, everyone?"

**Rocks:** "Three quarters food, full torches, good."

**Dusty:** "Half food, torches at 60%, tool fine."

**Foreman:** "We push for another five minutes, then we mark our turn point and head back. Mining on return trip. Eyes sharp."

**Dusty:** "Ravine ahead. And I see... diamonds. In the ravine wall. Across the gap."

**Foreman:** "How wide?"

**Dusty:** "Too wide to jump. Maybe six, seven blocks."

**Foreman:** "We build a bridge. Cobble, two blocks wide. Rails on both sides. I'll build, you two cover me. Rocks, how much cobble you have?"

**Rocks:** "Two stacks. Should be enough."

**Foreman:** "Let's do it. Those diamonds aren't going to mine themselves."

### Dialogue 8: Finding a Stronghold

**Dusty:** "Boss. You need to see this."

**Foreman:** "What is it?"

**Dusty:** "I was branch mining at Y -59, found something... weird. Not natural."

**Foreman:** "Show me."

**Footsteps descending]

**Foreman:** "That's... is that a room? A built room underground?"

**Dusty:** "I broke into the wall and found this. Look at the floor. That's a pattern. Not natural stone."

**Foreman:** "That's a stronghold. Or at least a piece of one. Mineshaft, maybe. Let me check the walls... stone bricks. Yeah, this is built."

**Rocks:** "No way. We just stumbled on it?"

**Dusty:** "Branch mining at the perfect Y-level for it, I guess."

**Foreman:** "This is big. Like, really big. Strongholds have end portals. Eyes of ender, silverfish, the whole deal."

**Sparks:** "So we hit the jackpot?"

**Foreman:** "Or walked into a death trap. Silverfish are no joke. And if this connects to a portal room, there might be more."

**Dusty:** "So we abort?"

**Foreman:** "Hell no. But we don't go in unprepared. We need: armor, weapons, water buckets, extra food. And we go as a team. Nobody explores this solo."

**Rocks:** "I can gear up in ten minutes."

**Foreman:** "Make it fifteen. Everyone: full iron armor minimum. Sharpness swords. Shields. Two water buckets each. Three stacks food. We're not messing around."

**Sparks:** "Should I... should I tell the client?"

**Foreman:** "Not yet. We explore first, confirm what we found, then report. No use getting their hopes up if it's just a library room."

**Dusty:** "You think it's just a library?"

**Foreman:** "Statistically, yes. Most stronghold rooms are libraries, staircases, or prisons. Portal rooms are rare. But even a library has loot."

**Rocks:** "Loot is good."

**Foreman:** "Loot is excellent. Enchanted books, apples, maybe even diamonds. But silverfish are the price. Anyone have experience with them?"

**Dusty:** "They swarm. Kill one, three more spawn. And they can hide in blocks."

**Foreman:** "Correct. So we don't attack blocks unnecessarily. We stick to the path. We don't mine the walls unless we have to. And we watch each other's backs."

**Sparks:** "What if we get overwhelmed?"

**Foreman:** "Then we retreat. Live to fight another day. Strongholds aren't going anywhere. They've been here for centuries, they'll be here tomorrow."

**Foreman:** "Fifteen minutes. Gear up. Meet back here. This is the biggest find we've had in months. Let's do it right."

**Dusty:** "Boss?"

**Foreman:** "Yeah, Dusty?"

**Dusty:** "Thanks for letting me find it."

**Foreman:** "That's what you do. You mine, you find. We handle the rest. Good work, kid. Real good work."

### Dialogue 9: The Night Shift

**Foreman:** "Status report. Where are we?"

**Dusty:** "Branch 47. Still going strong. Diamonds at 28. Tool at 40%. It's been a good night."

**Foreman:** "It's 3 AM, Dusty. You've been down there seven hours."

**Dusty:** "Lost track of time. The pick just keeps swinging, you know? Get in a rhythm, forget the world."

**Rocks:** "He's in the zone. I've seen it before. He'll keep going until he collapses or the pick breaks."

**Foreman:** "Dusty, you need to come up."

**Dusty:** "Just one more branch. I can feel it. This area's rich. Two diamonds in the last branch alone."

**Foreman:** "And at 3 AM, your judgment's impaired. Fatigue leads to mistakes. Mistakes lead to accidents."

**Dusty:** "I'm not tired. I'm focused. Never been more focused."

**Sparks:** "Boss, let me go down there. Talk to him face to face."

**Foreman:** "Go. But don't argue. If he won't come up, you come back. We're not losing two people to exhaustion."

**Sparks:** "On my way."

[Footsteps descending]

**Sparks:** "Dusty?"

**Dusty:** "Sparks. What are you doing here?"

**Sparks:** "Boss sent me. Says you've been down here seven hours."

**Dusty:** "Has it been that long? Feels like two."

**Sparks:** "That's the exhaustion talking. You're tired, Dusty. You just don't feel it because you're running on adrenaline."

**Dusty:** "I'm fine. Really. Just one more branch. Promise."

**Sparks:** "Remember last month? When you fell in that ravine because you were 'fine'?"

**Dusty:** "That was different. I was rushing then. I'm being careful now."

**Sparks:** "Are you? Look at your torch placement. Every 10 blocks. You usually do every 6. Look at your inventory. No organization. Usually you're tidy. You're slipping, Dusty. Even if you don't feel it."

**Dusty:** "I..."

**Sparks:** "I'm your friend. I'm telling you this as your friend. Come up. Sleep. The diamonds will still be here tomorrow. You might not be."

**Dusty:** "What if I can't sleep? What if I'm so wired I just lie there?"

**Sparks:** "Then I'll sit up with you. We'll talk. We'll eat. Whatever it takes. But you're not mining anymore tonight. That's final."

**Dusty:** "Boss put you up to this?"

**Sparks:** "Boss sent me down. This speech? This is all me. I'm worried about you, Dusty. We all are."

**Dusty:** "Alright. Alright, I hear you. Let me finish this branch."

**Sparks:** "No. Now. You walk away from this branch, we mark it, you come back tomorrow. That's the deal."

**Dusty:** "You're really not going to let me finish it?"

**Sparks:** "Would rather have you alive and annoyed than dead and obedient."

**Dusty:** "Fine. Let's go up. But I'm marking this branch. First thing tomorrow, I'm back here."

**Sparks:** "Deal. Let's go home, Dusty. You've done enough for one day. More than enough."

### Dialogue 10: Celebration After Success

**Foreman:** "Everyone, stop what you're doing. I have an announcement."

**Crew gathers**

**Foreman:** "This operation? Complete. And not just complete - record-breaking. In one day, we mined: thirty-two diamonds, twelve stacks iron, twenty stacks coal, plus redstone, lapis, gold. We found a stronghold. We cleared a cave system. Nobody died. Nobody even got hurt."

**Dusty:** "That's a lot of diamonds."

**Foreman:** "That's the single biggest diamond haul I've ever seen from one crew in one day. Dusty, that branch mining strategy you perfected? That's going in the handbook. Three-block spacing, torches on right, two-hour cycles. It's brilliant."

**Rocks:** "And my iron haul? That's gotta be a record too."

**Foreman:** "Six stacks of iron in four hours. Yes, Rocks, that's a record. You moved more material today than most crews move in a week."

**Sparks:** "And I just carried chests."

**Foreman:** "Without Sparks, nobody would have tools, food, or organization. Supply lines are the unsung hero of mining. You kept this operation running smooth, and that's worth more than diamonds."

**Dusty:** "So what happens now?"

**Foreman:** "Now? We celebrate. Tomorrow we're back to work. But tonight? Tonight we rest. We enjoy what we accomplished. We look at those chests full of diamonds and say 'we did that. WE did that.'"

**Rocks:** "I'll drink to that."

**Foreman:** "We all will. But first, I want each of you to know: this is the best crew I've ever led. Bar none. You work hard, you work smart, you work together. That's rare."

**Sparks:** "We learned from the best."

**Foreman:** "And you're making me look good. But seriously: excellent work today. Every single one of you. This is why we do this. This right here. Look at those hauls. That's not luck. That's skill. That's preparation. That's teamwork."

**Dusty:** "So... same time tomorrow?"

**Foreman:** "Same time tomorrow. But we're starting later. You've all earned a sleep-in. Nine AM instead of six. Don't get used to it."

**Rocks:** "You're too kind to us, boss."

**Foreman:** "I'm just pragmatic. Tired miners make mistakes. Tomorrow, we're fresh. And we're going to do it again. Because you know what?"

**Dusty:** "What?"

**Foreman:** "There's always more diamonds down there. Always. And we're the ones who're gonna find them."

**All:** "DAMN RIGHT."

**Foreman:** "Now go. Sleep. Dream of diamonds. I'll see you in the morning. Outstanding work, everyone. Truly outstanding."
