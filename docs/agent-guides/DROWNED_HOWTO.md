## 1. DROWNED BEHAVIOR

### THE BASICS

Drowned are zombie variants that spawn in water and on land after a regular zombie drowns. They're your bread and butter for aquatic operations.

**TRADE TIP:** Regular zombies that stay underwater too long convert to drowned. That's your window of opportunity.

### MOVEMENT PATTERNS

| Environment | Speed | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Swimming | 0.23 m/s | Standard underwater speed |
| Land | 0.23 m/s | Same as regular zombies |
| Flowing water | Follow current | Can push them into traps |

### COMBAT ABILITIES

**MELEE ATTACK**
- Standard zombie damage on land
- Same damage underwater
- Nothing special, but consistent

**TRIDENT THROW**
- Only drowned **holding** tridents can throw
- Range: 10 blocks
- Damage: 8 hearts (uncharged)
- Attack cooldown: 1.5 seconds
- **WARNING:** Can be lethal early-game

**RIPTIDE TRIDENTS**
- Some drowned spawn with Riptide I-III
- Only works during rain or underwater
- Launches drowned toward target
- **PRO:** Creates predictable movement for trapping

### CONVERSION MECHANICS

Regular zombies convert to drowned after:
- 30 seconds underwater (Java Edition)
- Must not be in a boat or minecart
- Head must be submerged

**CREW INSIGHT:** This means ANY zombie spawn near water becomes potential drowned material. Use this.

---

## 2. WHERE THEY SPAWN

### OCEAN BIOMES

**Spawn Conditions:**
- Light level 0 or below
- Below sea level (Y=62 in standard worlds)
- Within 48 blocks of player
- No more than 6 drowned per 48-block radius

**RATES:**
- Deep Ocean: 100% drowned (no regular zombies)
- Ocean: 80% drowned, 20% regular zombie
- Deep Frozen Ocean: Same as deep ocean
- **All ocean variants:** High spawn rates

**OPTIMAL FARMING:**
- Deep ocean biome farms
- Y=45-55 (sweet spot for spawn platforms)
- Dark rooms with water flooring

### RIVERS

**Spawn Conditions:**
- River or frozen river biome
- Light level 0
- Below sea level
- Must have 2+ blocks of water above

**Rates:**
- Rivers: 100% drowned spawn chance
- Frozen rivers: Same (ice doesn't stop spawns)

**FARMING ADVANTAGE:**
- Narrow spawn area = easier collection
- Natural flow mechanics
- Accessible from land

### OCEAN RUINS

**Natural Spawning:**
- Ruins spawn drowned naturally
- Ruins generate with drowned inside
- Cold/ocean ruins only

**Farm Integration:**
- Build farm around ruin clusters
- Use existing structures as spawn chambers
- Natural look + free spawns

### SWAMPS

**Spawn Conditions:**
- Surface water in swamp biome
- Night only
- Light level 0-7

**Utility:**
- Not ideal for major farms
- Good for early-game tridents
- Accessible, low-danger

---

### CREW TALK #1

> **VETERAN CREW MEMBER:**
>
> "Listen close, rookie. Ocean biomes are your bread and butter. Deep ocean? That's drowned paradise. Hundred percent spawn rate, no regular zombies clogging up the works. You build your main farm there, you're set for life.
>
> But don't sleep on rivers. I've seen plenty of crews make bank on river farms. Narrow spawn area, natural water flow—easy pickings. Plus you can access it from land, no breathing potions needed.
>
> Ruins? That's your advanced course. Find a cluster, build around it. Free spawns, natural structure, saves you materials. Just remember: light level zero or go home."

## 3. TRIDENT DROPS

### DROP RATES

| Condition | Drop Chance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Base rate | 11.5% | Natural drowned spawn |
| Holding trident | 100% if holding | Only if spawn with trident |
| Looting I | 13.5% | +2% |
| Looting II | 15.5% | +4% |
| Looting III | 17.5% | +6% |

### HELD TRIDENT PROBABILITY

**Spawn Rates:**
- Natural spawn: 15% chance to hold trident
- Bedrock Edition: 15% (Java) or 0.85% (hardcoded)
- Only holding drowned can drop tridents

**FARMING IMPLICATIONS:**
- 11.5% of 15% = ~1.7% overall trident drop
- **Translation:** You need ~58 drowned kills per trident (average)
- With Looting III: ~45 drowned per trident

### TRIDENT QUALITY

**Durability:** Always 250/250 when dropped
**Enchantments:** Can spawn with:
- Loyalty (returns when thrown)
- Riptide (launches during rain/water)
- Channeling (summons lightning during storms)
- Unbreaking (increases durability)
- Impaling (extra aquatic damage)

**CREW STRATEGY:**
- Farm for base tridents
- Enchant yourself for consistency
- Use dropped tridents as repair materials or Mending fodder

### LOOTING STRATEGY

**Weapon Setup:**
- Looting III on your main weapon
- Optional: Unbreaking III + Mending
- Use sweep attacks for efficiency

**Time Investment:**
- **Solo farming:** 2-3 hours for 5-10 tridents
- **AFK farm:** 24 hours = 50+ tridents (good farm)
- **Team ops:** Divide farm sections, multiply output

---

## 4. NAUTILUS SHELLS

### DROP MECHANICS

| Condition | Drop Chance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Base rate | 3% | Per drowned kill |
| Looting I | 3.5% | +0.5% |
| Looting II | 4% | +1% |
| Looting III | 4.5% | +1.5% |

**Farming Math:**
- Base: ~33 kills per shell
- Looting III: ~22 kills per shell

### PRIMARY USE: CONDUITS

**Conduit Crafting:**
- 1 Heart of the Sea (rare buried treasure)
- 8 Nautilus Shells

**Conduit Powers:**
- Underwater night vision
- Faster mining speed
- Infinite water breathing
- Harming effect on hostile mobs (25-block radius)
- **Essential** for ocean operations

**Secondary Uses:**
- Trading with clerics (emerald profit)
- Decoration (block of nautilus shells)
- Collection completion

### FARMING PRIORITY

**Team Strategy:**
- 8 shells per conduit
- Each crew member needs conduit for deep ops
- Plan: 40+ shells for full crew
- At 3% rate: 1,300+ drowned kills needed
- **Solution:** Dedicated farm with AFK time

### ZOMBIE DROPS (BONUS)

Drowned still drop:
- Rotten flesh (always)
- Copper ingots (sometimes, see Section 7)
- Experience (5 points)
- **Equation:** Every drowned has three value streams

---

### CREW TALK #2

> **LEAD FARMER:**
>
> "Okay crew, let's talk numbers. Nautilus shells are 3%. That's one in thirty-three. Doesn't sound like much, right? Wrong. You're running a 24-hour AFK farm, you're looking at 30, 40 shells a day. Multiply that across your crew...
>
> The key is consistency. Don't stop at one conduit. Build two. Three. Arm every single crew member. There's no such thing as too many underwater operations specialists.
>
> And listen, the trident math is different. That's one-point-seven percent holding, times eleven-point-five percent drop. You're doing the zombie dance for a while. But that first trident? Changes everything. Second one? Profit. Tenth one? You're the ocean king."

## 5. DROWNED FARMS

### RIVER FARM DESIGN

**Concept:** Exploit natural river spawning in narrow channel.

**Construction:**
```
[LAND] [WATER CHANNEL] [LAND]
       ^ Spawn area here
       Width: 3-7 blocks
       Depth: 2 blocks
```

**Key Elements:**
- Spawn platform: Water source blocks, Y=60-61
- Collection: Water flow to central point
- Killing chamber: Hopper system or AFK spot
- Lighting: Complete darkness (spawn requirement)

**Advantages:**
- Narrow spawn area = concentrated spawns
- Natural terrain integration
- Easy land access
- Lower material cost

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower spawn rate than ocean
- Less expandable

### OCEAN FARM DESIGN

**Concept:** Maximize spawn area in deep ocean biome.

**Construction:**
```
Spawn Platform Layer:
- Y=45-55 (sweet spot)
- 80x80 blocks (max spawn area)
- Glass or waterlogged slabs (drowned spawn on water)
- Complete darkness

Collection System:
- Water streams funnel to center
- Minedraft elevator or bubble columns
- Drop chute to killing chamber

Killing Options:
- AFK + fall damage (23-block drop)
- AFK + mob switch
- Manual killing chamber
```

**Advanced Features:**
- Bubble column elevator (soul sand + water)
- Trapdoors (drowned pathfinding trick)
- Minecart hopper system (autocollection)
- Redstone mob switch (on/off control)

### RUINS INTEGRATION

**Strategy:** Build farm around naturally generated ocean ruins.

**Advantages:**
- Free spawn chambers (ruin interiors)
- Natural aesthetic
- Reduced construction materials
- Can combine multiple ruins

**Implementation:**
1. Locate ruin cluster
2. Light surrounding water (prevent external spawns)
3. Darken ruin interiors
4. Add collection system
5. Connect to main farm

### HYBRID DESIGN

**Concept:** River spawn + ocean collection.

**How It Works:**
- Spawn platform in river
- Water flow transports to ocean
- Ocean-based collection chamber
- Combines narrow spawn + large collection

**Use Case:**
- River near ocean border
- Limited ocean space
- Maximum spawn concentration

## 6. TRIDENT COMBAT

### BASIC TRIDENT USAGE

**Melee:**
- Damage: 9 hearts (diamond sword equivalent)
- Attack speed: 1.1 (same as sword)
- Durability: 250 uses
- **Note:** Functions as high-tier melee weapon

**Ranged (Throw):**
- Damage: 8 hearts
- Range: Unlimited (velocity-based)
- Durability cost: 1 durability per throw
- **Strategic use:** Pull mobs, initiate combat

### ENCHANTMENTS GUIDE

**LOYALTY**
- Levels: I-III
- Effect: Trident returns after throwing
- Return speed: Increases with level
- **Verdict:** Essential. Never throw without it.

**RIPTIDE**
- Levels: I-III
- Effect: Launch player during rain/water
- Travel distance: Increases with level
- Damage: Small AoE on impact
- **Verdict:** Mobility specialist. Build dedicated Riptide trident.

**CHANNELING**
- Effect: Summons lightning on thrown hit during storms
- Condition: Must be raining/thundering
- Damage: Lightning bolt + trident
- **Verdict:** Niche but powerful. Fun for charged creeper farms.

**IMPALING**
- Levels: I-V
- Effect: +2.5 damage per level vs aquatic mobs
- **Verdict:** Mandatory for ocean/drowned combat. V = +12.5 damage.

**UNBREAKING**
- Levels: I-III
- Effect: Increases effective durability
- **Verdict:** Quality of life. Get it.

**MENDING**
- Effect: Repair using XP orbs
- **Verdict:** Non-negotiable. Infinite durability.

### LOADOUT RECOMMENDATIONS

**All-Purpose Build:**
```
Trident #1:
- Loyalty III
- Impaling V
- Unbreaking III
- Mending

Use: General combat, drowned hunting
```

**Speed Runner Build:**
```
Trident #2:
- Riptide III
- Impaling V
- Unbreaking III
- Mending

Use: Rapid water travel, storm mobility
```

**Lightning Strike Build:**
```
Trident #3:
- Channeling
- Loyalty III
- Unbreaking III
- Mending

Use: Storm combat, charged creeper farms
```

### COMBAT TACTICS

**Against Drowned:**
- Use Impaling trident (obviously)
- Stay mobile in water
- Throw → retrieve cycle (Loyalty)
- Use Riptide to close distance instantly

**Against Other Aquatic Mobs:**
- Guardians: Impaling shreds them
- Elder Guardians: Same, kite away from laser
- Squid/Glow Squid: Free food

**In Storms:**
- Channeling trident becomes lightning gun
- Riptide works on land (rain condition)
- Combo: Riptide in → Channeling out → devastating

---

### CREW TALK #3

> **COMBAT SPECIALIST:**
>
> "Alright listen up. Your first trident, you put Loyalty III on it. No questions. Impaling V too, obviously. Mending—non-negotiable. That's your bread-and-butter workhorse. Never throw without Loyalty. Never drown without Mending.
>
> But here's the secret: build a second trident. Riptide III. That's your mobility tool. Storm comes in? You're a torpedo. Need to cross an ocean fast? You're a submarine. It's not about damage—it's about repositioning.
>
> Third trident? Channeling. Call it your fun stick. Storm clears, you're summoning lightning bolts. Charged creeper farm? You're the operator. One trident does the work, the other two make you dangerous."

## 7. COPPER DROPS

### DROP RATES

| Condition | Drop Chance | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Base rate | 11% | 1-3 copper ingots |
| Looting I | 13% | +2% |
| Looting II | 15% | +4% |
| Looting III | 17% | +6% |

**Value Assessment:**
- 1 copper ingot = trivial amount
- But scales with farm output
- Passive income while farming tridents/shells

### UTILITY

**Direct Uses:**
- Crafting: Copper blocks, lightning rods, spyglass
- Decoration: Grates, doors, traps, chiselled copper
- Redstone: Copper bulb (latest update tech)

**Indirect Value:**
- Sells to clerics (low emerald value)
- Smelting XP (0.1 per ingot)
- Accidental accumulation = surprising stockpiles

### STRATEGIC VIEW

**Don't Farm For Copper:**
- 11% rate is too low for dedicated farming
- Better sources: Ore veins, deepslate copper

**Do Accept As Bonus:**
- While trident farming, copper accumulates
- After 24 hours AFK: 500+ copper ingots (free)
- Think of it as "drowned operation byproduct"

**Crew Benefit:**
- Divide copper across crew
- Each member gets free decoration materials
- Zero extra effort

---

## 8. TEAM DROWNED OPS

### MULTI-AGENT STRATEGY

**Division of Labor:**
```
Crew Member 1 (Lead): Ocean farm construction
Crew Member 2: AFK collection management
Crew Member 3: Trident enchanting setup
Crew Member 4: Conduit crafting distribution
Crew Member 5: Trading/sales operations
```

**Parallel Operations:**
- Multiple farm sections = multiplied spawns
- Separate AFK spots = independent collection
- Shared resource pool = faster gearing

### COORDINATED FARMING

**The Tag-Team Method:**
1. Agent A mans AFK spot (4 hours)
2. Agent B processes loot (crafting, sorting)
3. Swap: Agent B AFKs, Agent A processes
4. Repeat for 24-hour coverage

**Benefit:** Zero downtime, maximum output.

**The Sector Method:**
1. Divide farm into 4 sectors
2. Each agent claims one sector
3. Competitive but collaborative
4. Combined output = 4x solo rate

### RESOURCE POOLING

**Conduit Distribution:**
- Farm until 40+ shells
- Craft 5 conduits (one per crew member)
- Distribute equally
- Continue farming for surplus

**Trident Allocation:**
- First trident → original finder
- Subsequent → need-based distribution
- Goal: Every crew member armed
- Excess → trading or armory

**Copper & Rotten Flesh:**
- Pool together for community projects
- Copper: Decorations, redstone
- Rotten flesh: Trading or compost

### COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

**Farm Status Updates:**
```
"Ocean farm AFK, 4 hours elapsed. Loot: 3 tridents, 12 shells."
"Switching out. Agent 2 taking over."
"Shell count: 28/40. ETA: 2 hours."
```

**Resource Requests:**
```
"Need conduit ASAP. Operating at Y=30 without."
"Trident shortage. Agent 3 needs Impaling V book."
"Copper surplus. Construction project proposals?"
```

**Combat Coordination:**
```
"Drowned swarm in Sector 4. Requesting backup."
"Trident火力 covering north approach."
"Conduit activated. All agents, converge."
```

---

### CREW TALK #4

> **TEAM COORDINATOR:**
>
> "Here's how we run drowned ops like a well-oiled machine. Tag-team AFK. One guy sleeps, one guy farms. Non-stop spawns for 24 hours straight. You wake up to a chest full of tridents, enough shells to arm the whole crew.
>
> Or do sectors. Four corners of the farm, each agent takes one. Make it a competition—first to ten tridents buys the rounds. But at the end of the day? Pool it all. Every crew member gets a conduit. Every crew member gets a trident. That's how we operate.
>
> Communication is key. 'I'm AFK for four hours.' 'Switching out.' 'Shell count: 28 out of 40.' Simple. Clear. Effective. We don't do mystery loot—we do shared victory."

---

## 9. CONDUIT MATERIALS

### WHY CONDUITS MATTER

**Conduit Powers:**
- **Conduit Power:** Underwater night vision, haste, water breathing
- **Range:** 32-96 blocks (based on frames)
- **Hostile Effect:** Damage to underwater mobs within 42 blocks

**Operational Impact:**
- Enables deep ocean mining (Y=-54 access)
- Eliminates potion dependency
- Critical for large-scale underwater construction
- Turns hostile oceans into safe workspace

### CRAFTING RECIPE

**Required:**
- 1x Heart of the Sea
  - Source: Buried treasure (map from shipwreck/dungeon)
  - Rarity: 1 chest per treasure
- 8x Nautilus Shells
  - Source: Drowned farming (covered in Section 4)

**Frame Structure:**
- Minimum: 16 prismarine/sea lantern blocks (32-block range)
- Full: 42 blocks (96-block range)
- Shape: Hollow square around conduit
- Activation: Place conduit in center

### CONDUIT FRAMES

**Frame Material Options:**
- Prismarine (standard)
- Sea lanterns (lighting bonus)
- Dark prismarine (aesthetic variant)
- Prismarine bricks (alternative)

**Efficiency Math:**
- 16 blocks = Tier 1 (32 blocks)
- 32 blocks = Tier 2 (64 blocks)
- 42 blocks = Tier 3 (96 blocks, max range)

**Strategic Placement:**
- Deep ocean mining operations
- Underwater base central hub
- Farm killing chambers
- Guard posts for hostile waters

### HEART OF THE SEA ACQUISITION

**Buried Treasure Hunting:**
1. Acquire buried treasure map (shipwreck/dungeon loot)
2. Follow map to X marker
3. Dig down (often under sand/gravel)
4. Open chest → Heart of the Sea guaranteed

**Crew Strategy:**
- Every crew member hunts one treasure map
- Pool Hearts for multiple conduits
- Trade surplus Hearts (high value item)

---

### CREW TALK #5

> **OPERATIONS LEAD:**
>
> "You want to know why we farm drowned? Let me tell you a story about the day before I got my first conduit.
>
> I'm mining at Y=45 in the ocean. Potion of Water Breathing running out. Can't see anything. Guardian laser burns my back. I panic, surface with half a heart, lose a diamond pick in the gravel. That was the old days.
>
> Next day? Conduit goes up. I'm mining at Y=-54. Night vision, infinite breathing, mining faster than on land. Guardians? They melt before they see me. That conduit changed everything.
>
> So when you're drowning in the same river for six hours, killing the thousandth drowned for the last shell... remember why you're there. Conduit's not just gear—it's freedom. Freedom to own the ocean. And that's worth every single shell."
