## FOREWORD

Listen up, crew. You've mastered the pickaxe, you've laid blocks straighter than a laser level, and you know how to coordinate a build like a well-oiled machine. Now we're stepping up your game.

Tridents aren't just weapons—they're precision tools for the professional MineWright operator. When you're out on a job site and the sun starts dropping, you don't want to be fumbling with swords and bows. You want a tool that comes back to your hand, rain or shine.

This manual covers everything from acquisition to advanced tactics. Read it. Memorize it. Live it.

Your foreman depends on you. Your crew depends on you. And that trident? It depends on you not throwing it into the void.

## CREW TALK #1: The First Trident

**JUNIOR CREW:** "Hey Cap, I spent three nights at the swamp and came back with nothing but rotten flesh and a bad attitude. These Drowned aren't giving up their tridents."

**SENIOR FOREMAN:** "Kid, let me tell you about patience. First night, you're learning. Second night, you're getting your rhythm. Third night? That's when the Drowned start respecting you. You show up, same spot, same time, every night. They notice. They see you're not just some tourist throwing stones. You're there to work. By night five, six? They'll start handing them over just to make you go away. Trust me—I got my first trident on night seven, and it had Loyalty III. The job respects persistence."

## CHAPTER 1: GETTING A TRIDENT

### 1.1 UNDERSTANDING THE ACQUISITION PROCESS

**Translation for the AI Planner:** `ACQUIRE_TRIDENT` task with subtasks: `LOCATE_DROWNED_SPAWN`, `SET_UP_FARMING`, `HARVEST_TRIDENT`.

**The Reality:** You're going to need patience, a good sword, and a high tolerance for swamp gas.

### 1.2 DROWNED FARMING LOCATIONS

| BIOME | SPAWN RATE | NOTES |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| River | Low | Quick access, low yield |
| Swamp | Medium | Better spawn rates, lily pads for mobility |
| Ocean | High | Best rates, but watch your oxygen |
| Ocean Ruins | Very High | Guaranteed Drowned spawns, good loot potential |

**PRO TIP:** Ocean ruins are gold mines. Natural Drowned spawning plus chest loot means you're hitting two birds with one stone. Bring doors, torches, and at least two water breathing potions.

### 1.3 DROP RATES - THE NUMBERS GAME

**Base Drop Chance:** 15% per Drowned (Java Edition)

**Your numbers crew will tell you:**
- 10 Drowned killed = ~1.5 tridents (statistically)
- 50 Drowned killed = ~7.5 tridents
- 100 Drowned killed = ~15 tridents

**IN THE FIELD:** Never trust statistics. I've gone 40 kills with nothing, then gotten three in a row. That's just how the job works.

### 1.4 FARMING SETUP CHECKLIST

```
[ ] Sword with Looting III (non-negotiable)
[ ] Helmet with Respiration III or Aqua Affinity
[ ] Doors or sugar cane for air pockets
[ ] Torches for marking your farming zone
[ ] At least 16 cooked food (you'll be there a while)
[ ] Extra armor pieces - Drowned spawn with tridents in their hands
    and they'll use them. They can and will two-shot unarmored crew.
```

**SAFETY NOTE:** Drowned with tridents are crew-killers. They don't miss often, and they hit hard. Approach with caution, and never assume you're safe just because you're on shore.

---

## CHAPTER 2: TRIDENT COMBAT BASICS

### 2.1 MELEE USAGE

**Damage:** 9 damage (4.5 hearts) - same as a diamond sword
**Attack Speed:** 1.1 attacks per second (slower than sword)
**Durability:** 250 uses

**When to Melee:**
- You're in close quarters (underwater, confined spaces)
- You're conserving durability
- You need to finish off a weakened mob
- You don't have enchantments yet

**TECHNIQUE:** The trident has longer reach than a sword. Use this to your advantage—hit them before they can hit you.

### 2.2 RANGED USAGE

**Damage:** 8 damage (4 hearts) unenchanted
**Velocity:** Consistent, gravity-affected arc
**Range:** Approximately 24 blocks before significant drop

**When to Throw:**
- Target is at range (obviously)
- You need to apply Impaling damage to aquatic mobs
- You're setting up a Channeling strike
- You have Loyalty (always throw with Loyalty)

**THROWING MECHANICS:**
1. Right-click and hold to charge (no charge time—throw is instant)
2. Lead your target slightly—tridents have travel time
3. Account for drop on long shots
4. With Loyalty, position yourself so the return path is clear

---

## CREW TALK #2: The First Throw

**APPRENTICE:** "I just got it! My first trident! No enchants, but it's beautiful. What do I do now?"

**OLD TIMER:** "Go outside, find an open field, and throw it. Not at a target. Just throw it."

**APPRENTICE:** "But I'll lose it—"

**OLD TIMER:** "You'll go pick it up. That's the first lesson. A trident you're afraid to throw is just an expensive stick. Get comfortable with the throw, the arc, the feel. Then go find a cleric and get yourself some Mending. Because until you do, every throw is costing you durability. And after about 250 throws? You're walking back to the swamp with your tail between your legs. Respect the tool, but don't worship it. It's made to be thrown."

---

## CHAPTER 3: ENCHANTMENTS

### 3.1 THE BIG FOUR

| ENCHANTMENT | MAX LEVEL | WHAT IT DOES | PRIORITY |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Loyalty | III | Trident returns after throwing | CRITICAL |
| Riptide | III | Launch with you when in water/rain | HIGH |
| Channeling | I | Strikes lightning during storms | SITUATIONAL |
| Impaling | V | +2.5 damage/level to aquatic mobs | HIGH |

### 3.2 LOYALTY - THE BACKUP YOU CAN TRUST

**How It Works:**
- After throwing, the trident returns to you
- Speed increases with level (Loyalty III is significantly faster)
- Works across any distance
- DOES NOT work if thrown into the void

**Return Times (Approximate):**
- Loyalty I: ~4-6 seconds
- Loyalty II: ~2-3 seconds
- Loyalty III: ~1-2 seconds

**FIELD TIP:** Loyalty III feels instantaneous. You throw, you hear the "clink," and it's back. This is your bread and butter for combat effectiveness.

### 3.3 RIPTIDE - MOBILITY REDEFINED

**How It Works:**
- Right-click while in water or rain
- Launches you AND the trident forward
- No damage dealt, but incredible mobility
- Distance increases with level

**Launch Distances:**
- Riptide I: ~5 blocks
- Riptide II: ~7 blocks
- Riptide III: ~10+ blocks

**USE CASES:**
- Rapid vertical ascent (look straight up)
- Crossing water bodies instantly
- Escaping combat situations
- Reaching high places during rain

**IMPORTANT:** Does NOT work in air without rain. Does NOT deal damage. This is pure mobility.

### 3.4 CHANNELING - WHEN THORWS OWE YOU A FAVOR

**How It Works:**
- During thunderstorms, thrown tridents summon lightning
- Lightning strikes the target
- Works on any mob (except those immune)
- No damage boost on clear days

**WHAT IT DOES TO MOBS:**
| MOB | TRANSFORMATION |
|-----|----------------|
| Creeper | Charged Creeper (much more dangerous) |
| Pig | Pig Zombie (Zombified Piglin) |
| Villager | Witch |
| Mushroom Cow | Brown Mushroom Cow |

**USE CASES:**
- Creating charged creepers for heads (advanced tactic)
- Transforming villagers into witches (why would you do this?)
- Theatrical combat (there's no practical combat benefit)
- Showing off to apprentices (highly recommended)

**FIELD REQUIREMENT:** You need a thunderstorm. They're rare. Check weather reports if your crew has an astronomer.

### 3.5 IMPALING - FISH FRY SPECIALIST

**How It Works:**
- Bonus damage to aquatic mobs only
- +2.5 damage (1.25 hearts) per level
- Stacks with base damage

**Damage Chart (Impaling V):**

| TARGET | BASE DAMAGE | WITH IMPALING V |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Drowned | 8 | 20.5 (10 hearts) |
| Guardian | 8 | 20.5 (10 hearts) |
| Elder Guardian | 8 | 20.5 (10 hearts) |
| Dolphin | 8 | 20.5 (10 hearts) |
| Turtle | 8 | 20.5 (10 hearts) |
| Land Mob | 8 | 8 (no effect) |

**VERDICT:** If you're doing ocean monument raids, Impaling V is mandatory. For general overworld use? Skip it.

## CREW TALK #3: The Void Incident

**CREW LEAD:** "Where's your trident, Jenkins?"

**JENKINS:** "... I threw it at a phantom."

**CREW LEAD:** "And?"

**JENKINS:** "And it went over the edge. Into the void."

**CREW LEAD:** "Let me guess. No Loyalty."

**JENKINS:** "It had Riptide III! I was saving it for—"

**CREW LEAD:** "Let me stop you right there. Let me tell you about the void. The void doesn't give things back. Not tridents, not excuses, not crew who fall off ledges. That trident is gone, Jenkins. It's not coming back. And until you go back to that swamp and spend another week farming Drowned, you're on bow duty. Learn from this. Never throw without Loyalty. Not for fun, not for practice, not to show off. The void is always hungry."

---

## CHAPTER 4: LOYALTY MECHANICS IN DETAIL

### 4.1 THE RETURN JOURNEY

When you throw a Loyalty-enchanted trident, it follows a predictable path:

1. **Impact Phase:** Trident hits target or ground
2. **Delay Phase:** Brief pause (0.5-1 second)
3. **Return Phase:** Flies back to you, ignoring obstacles
4. **Catch Phase:** Returns to your inventory or drops at your feet

**SPECIAL BEHAVIOR:**
- The trident phases through blocks during return
- It can return up to Y=256 in the Overworld
- Return speed is constant regardless of distance
- If you die before it returns, it drops at your death location

### 4.2 VOID LOSS - THE PERMANENT VACATION

**THE HARD RULE:** If a Loyalty trident enters the void (Y < -64 in Overworld, Y < -128 in Nether), it is gone forever.

**How This Happens:**
- Throwing off high cliffs in the End
- Missing throws into the void
- Knockback from mobs sending your trident into the void
- Throwing while flying with elytra and missing your trajectory

**PREVENTION:**
- Always position yourself with solid ground behind your target
- Never throw at void-adjacent targets unless you're confident
- Consider using a ranged weapon (bow/crossbow) for void-edge combat
- If you must throw, throw with an arc, not straight

### 4.3 LOYALTY VS RIPTIDE COMPATIBILITY

**IMPORTANT:** Loyalty and Riptide are mutually exclusive on the same trident. You cannot have both.

**Decision Matrix:**

| SITUATION | BETTER CHOICE | REASONING |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| General combat | Loyalty | Ranged damage + return |
| Ocean monument | Loyalty | Need Impaling + range |
| Weather travel | Riptide | Rain-powered mobility |
| Water body crossing | Riptide | Instant traversal |
| Guardian temple | Loyalty | Combat focus |
| Shipwreck salvage | Loyalty | Need range in water |

---

## CHAPTER 5: RIPTIDE USAGE

### 5.1 WEATHER REQUIREMENTS

**Riptide works in:**
- Any water source (still or flowing)
- Any water depth (even 1 block)
- Rain (any intensity)
- Snow (technically precipitation)

**Riptide does NOT work in:**
- Air without precipitation
- Lava
- The End (no weather)
- Nether (no water, no rain)

### 5.2 ELEVATION TACTICS

**Vertical Launch:**
- Look straight up, activate Riptide
- Launches vertically ~10+ blocks (Riptide III)
- Useful for scaling cliffs, escaping caves, reaching surface

**Horizontal Launch:**
- Look parallel to water/rain
- Maximum distance travel
- Useful for crossing oceans quickly

**Angle Launch:**
- 45-degree angle gives both height and distance
- Good for reaching elevated platforms across gaps

### 5.3 COMBINATION TECHNIQUES

**Riptide + Elytra:**
1. Start with Riptide launch from water
2. Deploy elytra at peak of launch
3. Gain significant initial velocity for gliding
4. Use fireworks for sustained flight

**Riptide + Potion of Leaping:**
- Jump boost extends Riptide distance
- Useful for reaching high caves from water

**Riptide + Soul Speed:**
- If you land on soul sand/soul soil, maintain momentum
- Advanced technique, limited use cases

---

## CHAPTER 6: CHANNELING OPERATIONS

### 6.1 STORM REQUIREMENTS

**Thunderstorm Detection:**
- Rain intensity increases
- Lightning flashes visible (even without clouds)
- Darker ambient lighting
- Can occur in any dimension except the Nether

**Storm Duration:**
- Natural storms: 0.5 - 1 game day
- Can be extended with commands (cheating, but useful for testing)
- Cannot be artificially created in vanilla survival

### 6.2 MOB TRANSFORMATIONS

**CHARGED CREEPER:**
- Explosion radius: 3x normal creeper
- Damage: Much higher
- Use: Creates mob heads when it kills mobs
- Danger: EXTREME - avoid unless intentional

**PIG TO ZOMBIFIED PIGLIN:**
- Immediate hostility toward attacker
- Calls reinforcements (other piglins)
- Generally pointless transformation

**VILLAGER TO WITCH:**
- Loses all trades, gains witch abilities
- Why would you do this
- Seriously don't do this

**MUSHROOM COWN TRANSFORMATION:**
- Brown mushroom cow
- Gives mushroom stew when milked
- Actually useful? Barely

### 6.3 PRACTICAL CHANNELING USES

**Mob Head Farming:**
1. Wait for thunderstorm
2. Channel a creeper
3. Have it kill other mobs
4. Collect heads from those mobs
5. Advanced technique, requires setup

**Theatrical Combat:**
- Strike enemies with lightning
- Intimidation factor
- No practical damage benefit (direct hit already does damage)

**Construction Sites:**
- Clear areas quickly (dangerous)
- Set up lightning rod for controlled strikes
- Generally not worth the risk

---

## CREW TALK #4: The Channeling Mistake

**BRIDGE CREW CHIEF:** "We were building the ocean monument frame. Big job. Had three apprentices underwater, placing conduit frames. Storm rolled in—perfect timing, right?"

**APPRENTICE:** "I had just gotten Channeling on my trident! First time seeing a storm since! I saw a guardian and thought, 'This is it. This is my moment.'"

**BRIDGE CREW CHIEF:** "I saw the lightning strike from the surface. Felt the thunder through the water. Then I saw the conduit activate. The apprentice had channeled the guardian, and the guardian had—somehow—hit the conduit frame structure. The whole thing lit up. Every elder guardian in the monument woke up at once."

**APPRENTICE:** "I thought Channeling did extra damage!"

**BRIDGE CREW CHIEF:** "It does lightning damage. Which wakes up everything. We had to abort the job. Lost three days of work. The lesson? Sometimes the cool enchantment isn't the smart choice. Channeling is for show, not for professional work."

---

## CHAPTER 7: IMPALING DEEP DIVE

### 7.1 AQUATIC MOB LIST

**Mobs Affected by Impaling:**
- Drowned (yes, they're undead AND aquatic)
- Guardians
- Elder Guardians
- Dolphins
- Turtles
- Axolotls
- Fish (cod, salmon, pufferfish, tropical fish)

**Mobs NOT Affected (even if in water):**
- Regular zombies in water
- Skeletons in water
- Players in water
- Squids (glitch, but confirmed)

### 7.2 DAMAGE CALCULATIONS

**Base Damage:** 8 (4 hearts)

**With Impaling V:** 8 + (5 × 2.5) = 20.5 damage (10.25 hearts)

**One-Shot Potential:**
- Drowned: One shot (20 health)
- Guardian: One shot (30 health but needs two hits)
- Dolphin: One shot (10 health)
- Turtle: One shot (30 health but needs two hits for adult)

**STRATEGY:** Against Guardians and Elder Guardians, Impaling V + Loyalty = fastest clear times. No contest.

### 7.3 NON-AQUATIC COMBAT

**Important:** Impaling does NOTHING to land mobs. Zero bonus. Not even if they're standing in water.

**Therefore:** If you're fighting primarily land mobs, Impaling is wasted enchantment space. Consider other options or skip entirely.

---

## CHAPTER 8: REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

### 8.1 DURABILITY BASICS

**Base Durability:** 250 uses

**Durability Costs:**
- Melee attack: 1 durability
- Ranged attack: 1 durability
- Riptide launch: 1 durability
- No durability cost for return flight (Loyalty)

### 8.2 MENDING - THE GAME CHANGER

**How Mending Works:**
- Collects XP orbs to repair items
- Repairs 2 durability per XP orb
- Prioritizes held items, then damaged items in inventory
- Requires at least one equipment slot with Mending

**OPTIMAL STRATEGY:**
- Keep trident in offhand or hotbar when not in use
- Let other equipment take damage first
- Switch to trident when you want to repair it
- Always collect XP from kills with Mending trident equipped

**TRIDENT STACKING:**
- Can hold multiple Mending tridents
- XP distributes based on damage
- Useful for maintaining backup tridents

### 8.3 REPAIR COSTS (ANVIL)

**Without Mending:**
- Material cost: 1 Prismarine Shard + 1 Prismarine Crystals per 25% durability
- Level cost: Increases with prior repair work
- Prior Work penalty: Can make items too expensive to repair

**With Mending:**
- Anvil repair rarely needed
- Only for combining enchantments
- Much cheaper long-term

**VERDICT:** Mending is MANDATORY for combat tridents. Non-negotiable. Get it from fishing, trading, or loot chests.

### 8.4 COMBINING ENCHANTMENTS

**Anvil Strategy:**
1. Start with a trident with one good enchantment
2. Find another trident with a different enchantment
3. Combine in anvil
4. Repeat until all desired enchantments are on one trident
5. Add Mending last (most expensive)

**Example Progression:**
```
Trident A (Loyalty III) + Trident B (Impaling III)
= Trident C (Loyalty III, Impaling III)

Trident C + Trident D (Mending)
= Trident E (Loyalty III, Impaling III, Mending)

Trident E + Book (Unbreaking III)
= Final Trident (complete)
```

---

## CHAPTER 9: TEAM TRIDENT OPERATIONS

### 9.1 COORDINATED THROWING

**FORMATIONS:**

**Line Formation:**
- Crew stands in a line, 3 blocks apart
- All throw simultaneously at advancing mob wave
- Creates a "wall" of tridents
- Maximum coverage, minimum friendly fire

**V Formation:**
- Point crew throws first
- Wing crew throw to flanks
- Encircles target group
- Good for mob herding

**Circle Formation:**
- Crew surrounds target area
- All throw inward
- Eliminates escape routes
- Use with extreme caution

### 9.2 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

**Standard Calls:**
- "THROWING!" - Alerting nearby crew
- "CLEAR!" - Safe to throw, no crew in line of fire
- "HOLD!" - Stop throwing, crew in danger
- "RETRIEVING" - Thrown trident incoming, watch position

**Team Chat Commands:**
- `/trident throw <target>` - Coordinated throw order
- `/trident hold` - Cease fire
- `/trident status` - Report trident durability and position

### 9.3 SPECIALIZED TEAM ROLES

**Point Thrower:**
- First to engage
- Highest-enchanted trident
- Usually Loyalty III + Impaling V
- Sets up for rest of team

**Support Thrower:**
- Follows up point
- Focuses on cleanup
- May have Riptide for mobility

**Reserve:**
- Holds backup tridents
- Repairs and distributes
- Maintains team equipment

### 9.4 ADVANCED TACTICS

**The Trinity Throw:**
- Three crew throw simultaneously at one target
- Overkill damage ensures elimination
- Used for dangerous targets (Elder Guardians, Charged Creepers)

**The Boomerang:**
- Lead thrower draws aggro
- Support throws from flanks
- Lead throws again on return path
- Continuous damage cycle

**The Waterfall:**
- Team with Riptide tridents cascade upward
- Used for rapid vertical assault
- Requires rain or water source

---

## CREW TALK #5: The Monument Raid

**OPERATIONS LEAD:** "We had six crew for the ocean monument. All with Loyalty III tridents, all with Impaling V. We'd practiced the formation for weeks."

**TEAM COORDINATOR:** "The plan was simple. Point crew draws the first guardian. Support crew flanks. Reserve covers the rear. Continuous throwing, no downtime."

**OPERATIONS LEAD:** "What we didn't account for was the elder guardian's curse. We're all Mining Fatigue III. Our throw rhythm is off. The tridents are coming back slow, or not at all."

**TEAM COORDINATOR:** "So we adapt. Point crew switches to swords. Support crew keeps throwing. Reserve crew starts placing conduit frames mid-combat. Chaos."

**OPERATIONS LEAD:** "We cleared it. Took us three hours instead of two, but we cleared it. The lesson? Practice is good, but adaptability is better. Your trident is a tool, not a crutch. When the plan fails, the crew that can improvise survives."

---

## APPENDIX B: TROUBLESHOOTING

| PROBLEM | LIKELY CAUSE | SOLUTION |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Trident not returning | No Loyalty enchantment | Get a new trident with Loyalty |
| Trident lost in void | Thrown over edge | Never throw near void without backup |
| Riptide not working | Not in water/rain | Wait for rain or enter water |
| Channeling not working | No thunderstorm | Wait for storm or use different tactic |
| Low durability | Extensive use | Apply Mending or repair |
| Can't enchant | Enchantment table limit | Use anvil for advanced enchantments |
| Tridents clumping | Poor team coordination | Improve spacing and communication |

---

## FINAL NOTES

Tridents are powerful tools in the hands of trained crew. They're also expensive to replace. Respect the equipment, respect your team, and respect the job.

**REMEMBER:**
- Never throw without Loyalty near the void
- Always carry a backup weapon
- Mending is mandatory for combat tridents
- Communication saves lives (and equipment)
- Practice before deployment
