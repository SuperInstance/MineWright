## The Basics

Listen up, crew. Brewing isn't just mixing liquids—it's chemistry, timing, and knowing exactly what effect you need for the job at hand. A good brewer can mean the difference between a successful raid and a respawn screen. This manual covers everything from basic awkward potions to advanced combat cocktails.

**Why It Matters:** Potions give us temporary advantages we can't get any other way. Fire resistance in the Nether, night vision in caves, strength for boss fights—these aren't luxuries, they're tools of the trade.

---

## Tools of the Trade

### Equipment Checklist

**Required Setup:**
- **Brewing Stand** (1 blaze rod + 3 cobblestone) - Your workstation
- **Blaze Powder** (fuel) - Powers the brewing process (20 seconds per powder)
- **Glass Bottles** (3 glass per bottle) - Container for your potions
- **Water Source** - Cauldron or any water block for filling bottles

**Storage Organization:**
- **Ingredients Chest** - All brewing materials sorted by type
- **Base Potions Barrel** - Pre-brewed awkward potions for quick deployment
- **Finished Potions Shelves** - Organized by effect (positive, negative, splash)
- **Emergency Combat Stash** - Pre-brewed splash potions for raids

**Fuel Management:**
- 1 Blaze Powder = 20 seconds brewing time
- Most potions take 20 seconds to brew
- Plan batches: 3 potions per stand per fuel unit
- Keep at least 64 blaze powder stocked for extended operations

---

## How It's Done

### Step 1: Setup Your Brewing Station

**Location Matters:**
- Place brewing stands near water sources for quick bottle filling
- Keep ingredient storage within 16 blocks
- Multiple stands allow parallel brewing (3-4 stands optimal)
- Use hoppers for automation in high-volume setups

**Station Layout:**
```
[Cauldron] [Brewing Stand] [Brewing Stand] [Brewing Stand]
      [Ingredients Chest] [Base Potions Barrel]
                  [Finished Potions Shelves]
```

### Step 2: Prepare Water Bottles

**Bottle Filling Protocol:**
1. Craft glass bottles (3 glass = 3 bottles)
2. Fill bottles from water source (right-click water or cauldron)
3. Stack up to 64 empty bottles for efficiency
4. Fill 3 bottles at a time per brewing stand

**Pro Tip:** Always keep 3 stacks of empty bottles pre-filled. You don't want to be fumbling with glass when the crew needs potions NOW.

### Step 3: Brew Base Potions

**The Three Foundations:**

| Base Potion | Ingredient | Result | Usage |
|-------------|------------|--------|-------|
| **Awkward Potion** | Nether Wart | Base for most effect potions | Primary foundation |
| **Mundane Potion** | Redstone/Glistering Melon/Sugar | Extended mundane (no effect) | Thick base only |
| **Thick Potion** | Glowstone Dust | Thick base (no effect) | No practical use |

**Brewing Sequence:**
1. Place 3 water bottles in brewing stand
2. Add Nether Wart to fuel slot
3. Wait 20 seconds → 3 Awkward Potions
4. Repeat until you have adequate base potions

**Batch Production:**
- Target: 3-6 stacks of awkward potions for base stock
- Reason: Most potions start from awkward, having base ready saves time
- Storage: Keep in dedicated barrel labeled "BASE AWKWARD"

### Step 4: Add Effect Ingredients

**Positive Effects Brewing Chart:**

| Effect | Ingredient | Base Required | Duration (Level I) |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Speed | Sugar | Awkward | 3:00 |
| Slowness | (See Inversion) | - | - |
| Haste | (See Inversion) | - | - |
| Mining Fatigue | (See Inversion) | - | - |
| Strength | Blaze Powder | Awkward | 3:00 |
| Instant Health | Glistering Melon | Awkward | Instant |
| Poison | Spider Eye | Awkward | 0:45 |
| Regeneration | Ghast Tear | Awkward | 0:45 |
| Fire Resistance | Magma Cream | Awkward | 3:00 |
| Night Vision | Golden Carrot | Awkward | 3:00 |
| Invisibility | Fermented Spider Eye | Night Vision Potion | 3:00 |
| Water Breathing | Pufferfish | Awkward | 3:00 |
| Leaping | Rabbit's Foot | Awkward | 3:00 |
| Slow Falling | Phantom Membrane | Awkward | 1:30 |

**Brewing Process:**
1. Load 3 awkward potions into stand
2. Add effect ingredient to fuel slot
3. Wait 20 seconds → 3 effect potions
4. Remove and store appropriately

**Efficiency Note:** Brew in multiples of 3. Your stand handles 3 bottles at once—don't waste capacity.

### Step 5: Amplify or Extend

**The Two Enhancement Paths:**

**Redstone (Duration Extension):**
- Extends most potions to 8:00 (from 3:00)
- Applied AFTER effect ingredient
- Examples: Speed 8:00, Strength 8:00, Fire Resistance 8:00
- Cannot combine with Glowstone (mutually exclusive)

**Glowstone Dust (Potency Amplification):**
- Upgrades to Level II (double effect, half duration)
- Applied AFTER effect ingredient
- Examples: Strength II (1:30), Speed II (1:30), Poison II (0:22)
- Instant Health becomes Instant Health II (more healing)
- Cannot combine with Redstone (choose one)

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- **Redstone for:** Long operations (mining, building, exploration)
- **Glowstone for:** Combat, boss fights, emergency situations
- **Neither for:** Quick tasks, testing, low-stakes situations

### Step 6: Convert to Splash or Lingering

**Splash Potions (Throwable):**
- Ingredient: Gunpowder
- Applied to ANY finished potion
- Effect radius: ~4.5 blocks
- Duration: 25% of drinkable duration
- Tactical use: Crowd control, team buffs, debuff enemies

**Lingering Potions (Area Effect Cloud):**
- Ingredient: Dragon's Breath
- Applied ONLY to splash potions (must convert to splash first)
- Effect radius: ~3 blocks persistent cloud
- Duration: Cloud lasts 30 seconds, entities inside get effect every 0.5 seconds
- Tactical use: Area denial, trap setting, strategic positioning

**Conversion Order:**
1. Brew drinkable potion
2. Add Gunpowder → Splash Potion
3. Add Dragon's Breath → Lingering Potion

**Combat Note:** Splash potions are your bread and butter for raids. Lingering potions are specialty items for specific tactical situations.

## Know Your Environment

### The Nether Brewing Run

**Essential Nether Resources:**
- **Nether Wart** (Fortresses) - Base for all potions
- **Blaze Rods** (Nether Fortresses) - Brewing fuel + Strength potion
- **Magma Cream** (Magma Cubes) - Fire Resistance
- **Ghast Tears** (Ghasts) - Regeneration
- **Piglin Trading** (Gold Ingots) - Ender Pearls for brewing (rare)

**Nether Brewing Protocol:**
1. Establish safe brewing station in fortress
2. Harvest Nether Wart (plant at base for renewable supply)
3. Kill Blazes for rods (powder for fuel + rods for brewing)
4. Hunt Magma Cubes in basalt deltas
5. Collect Ghast Tears (rare, prioritize other ingredients first)

**Safety Equipment:**
- Fire Resistance potions (extended, 8:00)
- Strength potions for Blaze fights
- Healing splash for emergencies
- Building blocks to escape bad situations

### Overworld Resource Gathering

**Common Ingredients:**
- **Sugar** (Sugar Cane) - Speed potions
- **Spider Eyes** (Spiders) - Poison
- **Fermented Spider Eye** (Spider Eye + Mushroom + Sugar) - Inversion
- **Rabbit's Foot** (Rabbits) - Leaping
- **Pufferfish** (Fishing) - Water Breathing
- **Golden Carrot** (Carrot + Gold Nuggets) - Night Vision
- **Glistering Melon** (Melon + Gold Nuggets) - Healing
- **Phantom Membrane** (Phantoms) - Slow Falling

**Farming Priorities:**
1. **Sugar Cane Farm** - Speed potions essential
2. **Spider Farm** - Poison + Fermented Eyes for inversion
3. **Rabbit Farm** - Leaping potions useful for building
4. **Fishing Pond** - Pufferfish for water breathing
5. **Gold Farm** - Gold nuggets for expensive ingredients

### End Dimension Resources

**Dragon's Breath:**
- Source: Ender Dragon breath attack
- Collection: Use glass bottles when dragon breathes
- Rarity: 1-3 bottles per dragon fight (respawn required for more)
- Use case: Lingering potions (specialty, not high-volume)
- Priority: Low - Dragon's breath is expensive, use sparingly

## Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Potion brewing fails | Wrong ingredient order | Check recipe, ingredients must be added in sequence |
| No effect from drinking | Mundane/Thick potion | These have no effect, start from Awkward potion |
| Can't extend duration | Already amplified with Glowstone | Redstone and Glowstone are mutually exclusive |
| Potion too weak | Didn't use Glowstone | Add Glowstone for Level II effects |
| Potion too short | Didn't use Redstone | Add Redstone for extended duration |
| Can't make Lingering | Applied Dragon's Breath to drinkable | Must convert to Splash first |
| Wasted ingredients | Wrong base potion | Use Awkward for most effects, check recipe |
| Out of blaze powder | Poor fuel management | Keep 64+ powder stocked, plan batches |
| Wrong effect | Added wrong ingredient | Each ingredient has specific effect |
| Splash potion doesn't work | Thrown at feet, not target | Aim at enemies or ground near team |

**Troubleshooting Protocol:**
1. Verify base potion (should be Awkward for most effects)
2. Check ingredient order (water → base → effect → enhance → splash)
3. Confirm fuel (blaze powder in slot)
4. Wait full 20 seconds per step
5. Remove potions before next ingredient

## Crew Talk

### Dialogue 1: Emergency Nether Run

**Mace (Foreman):** "We've got a Nether fortress expedition leaving in 20. I need potions prepped."

**Circuit (Alchemy):** "On it, boss. Standard Nether loadout? Fire Resistance extended, Strength II, Healing splash?"

**Mace:** "That's the pattern. Quantities?"

**Circuit:** "Fire Res extended: 6 bottles, 8 minutes each. That's 48 minutes of fire immunity for the team. Strength II: 12 splash for coordinated application. Healing II: 8 splash for emergencies. Total 26 potions."

**Mace:** "Ingredients?"

**Circuit:** "Nether wart's stocked—48 units. Magma cream: need 18, have 12. Blaze powder: need 20 for fuel plus 12 for Strength. Running low on blazes, Foreman."

**Mace:** "Noted. I'll send a blaze hunting team. You just brew."

**Circuit:** "Already started the first batch. Water bottles filled, awkward potions brewing. By the time the hunting team returns, I'll have the base ready. Just need the blaze rods to finish."

**Mace:** "Good work. Get those potions ready. I don't want anyone burning to death today."

**Circuit:** "No one burns on my watch, boss. Brewing stand's hot."

---

### Dialogue 2: Raid Preparation

**Shield (Combat):** "Foreman, raid's incoming. Wave 5 expected. We need combat potions."

**Mace:** "Circuit, what's the status?"

**Circuit:** "Combat stash is stocked but I need to verify. Let me check... Shield, you're point defense. Strength II splash is your primary. I've got 8 ready. Speed II for maneuvering—6 splash. Healing II splash for emergency recovery—12 bottles."

**Shield:** "What about debuff potions? Poison for the Ravagers?"

**Circuit:** "Good thinking. Poison II splash: 4 bottles. Will apply on first Ravager spawn. Also have 2 Slowness splash if we need to slow the pillagers."

**Mace:** "Distribution plan?"

**Circuit:** "Shield, you get first pick on Strength II. Frame and Draft, you're on Speed II for positioning. I'll hold the Healing splash and coordinate team healing. Foreman, you decide on debuff timing."

**Mace:** "Do it. Circuit, stay near the front line. I want instant healing when Shield takes damage."

**Circuit:** "Already moving, boss. Brewing stand's on standby for contingency. If we run low, I can brew mid-raid."

**Shield:** "Let's hope it doesn't come to that. But good to know."

**Circuit:** "Always prepare for the worst case. That's why we brew."

---

### Dialogue 3: Resource Crisis

**Circuit:** "Foreman, we've got a problem. Blaze powder supply is critical. I've got 4 powder left—that's 80 seconds of brewing time. Not enough for full combat loadout."

**Mace:** "How did we let this happen?"

**Circuit:** "Last Nether run was light on blaze kills. Fortress was spawned weird, lots of wither skeletons, few blazes. I reported it but we haven't prioritized a return trip."

**Mace:** "Priorities shift. We've got a raid tonight. What can you brew with what we have?"

**Circuit:** "Math time. 4 powder = 4 batches maximum, 3 potions per batch = 12 potions total. Not enough. I can brew: 3 Strength II, 3 Healing II, 3 Fire Res, 3 Speed. That's bare minimum."

**Mace:** "That's not going to cut it."

**Circuit:** "Alternative: Skip some effects. We don't need Speed for raid defense—terrain's flat. Focus on Strength, Healing, Fire Resistance for Ravagers. That lets me brew 4 of each, 12 total. Better distribution."

**Mace:** "Do that. And send a team to the Nether NOW. I want 64 blaze powder before the raid starts."

**Circuit:** "On it. I'll brew what we can, send the hunters, and have the brewing stand ready for second-wave production. We'll be fully stocked before the first Ravager spawns."

**Mace:** "Make it happen. Resource management is your job, Circuit."

**Circuit:** "Already failed once, Foreman. Won't happen twice. Hunters are en route."

---

### Dialogue 4: Potion Inversion Strategy

**Professor (Tactician):** "Circuit, I've got a question about negative effects. Why brew Poison when we could brew Strength?"

**Circuit:** "Different use cases, Professor. Poison's for debuffing enemies. Throw a Poison II splash at a crowd, they all take damage over time. We don't have to swing."

**Professor:** "But isn't direct damage more efficient?"

**Circuit:** "Not always. Poison works while we're doing other things. Take the witch farm—we throw Poison splash, keep farming, the witches die while we work. It's background processing."

**Professor:** "Ah, I see. Asynchronous damage application."

**Circuit:** "Exactly. Plus, some potions can be inverted. Fermented Spider Eye turns positive effects negative. Speed becomes Slowness, Night Vision becomes Invisibility, Strength becomes Weakness."

**Professor:** "Why would we want Weakness?"

**Circuit:** "Golden apples! Weakness reduces damage from undead. If you're fighting a wither or a horde of zombies, Weakness splash saves your armor. And you can cure zombie villagers with Weakness plus a golden apple."

**Professor:** "So the inverted potion isn't a mistake—it's a different tool."

**Circuit:** "Right. The database isn't wrong when it says fermented spider eye makes potions 'bad'. It makes them different. Know your ingredients, know your effects. That's brewing."

---

### Dialogue 5: Large-Scale Brewing Operation

**Mace:** "Circuit, we've got a big operation coming. Wither skeleton farm construction, plus the dragon fight preparation. I need maximum potion output."

**Circuit:** "Scalability, boss. I've been running the numbers. We've got 4 brewing stands. If I run all 4 in parallel, that's 12 potions every 20 seconds. 3 potions per minute per stand."

**Mace:** "Give me the full picture."

**Circuit:** "For the wither farm: We need Fire Resistance extended (8 minutes) for the blaze spawner room. That's Nether wart + magma cream + redstone. We'll need 16 bottles for the construction team. Brewing time: 4 batches across 4 stands, 80 seconds total."

**Mace:** "And the dragon fight?"

**Circuit:** "End game loadout. Strength II, Instant Health II, Slow Falling for the void, maybe some Water Breathing for the exit fountain. Dragon's Breath for lingering potions if we want to get fancy. That's complex brewing—multiple effect paths, different enhancement strategies."

**Professor:** "What's the ingredient requirement?"

**Circuit:** "Let me calculate... For full loadout across 4 team members: 48 Strength II, 32 Healing II, 16 Slow Falling, 8 Water Breathing. That's 104 potions total. At 12 potions per batch, that's 9 batches. 9 batches at 20 seconds each... 3 minutes of brewing time per stand."

**Mace:** "But ingredient cost?"

**Circuit:** "Nether wart: 104 units. Blaze powder: 104 for fuel plus 48 for Strength. Glistering melon: 32. Sugar: 48 for Slow Falling. Pufferfish: 8. Gold nuggets: massive—need 192 for glistering melon alone."

**Professor:** "That's a significant resource investment."

**Circuit:** "It is. But it's also a force multiplier. Those 104 potions mean 4 crew members can kill the dragon without taking damage. That's efficiency."

**Mace:** "Do it. Circuit, coordinate with Sparks for blaze hunting, with Professor for gold farming. I want potions brewed and ready before we enter the End."

**Circuit:** "Already planning the production pipeline, boss. Brewing's the easy part—ingredients are the logistics challenge. But we'll be ready."

## Advanced Techniques

### Fermented Spider Eye Inversions

**The Inversion Table:**

| Base Potion | Add Fermented Spider Eye | Result |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------|
| Speed | → | Slowness |
| Strength | → | Weakness |
| Leaping | → | Slowness |
| Night Vision | → | Invisibility |
| Regeneration | → | (No effect - creates Mundane) |
| Poison | → | (No effect - remains Poison) |

**Strategic Uses:**
- **Invisibility:** Night Vision → Fermented Spider Eye → Invisibility
- **Weakness:** Strength → Fermented Spider Eye → Weakness (for zombie villager cures)
- **Slowness:** Speed or Leaping → Fermented Spider Eye → Slowness (for crowd control)

### Lingering Potion Tactics

**Area Denial:**
- Lingering Poison II creates deadly cloud
- Lingering Slowness creates escape-prevention zone
- Lingering Instant Health creates team healing zone

**Trap Setting:**
- Place lingering potions before enemy arrival
- Cloud persists for 30 seconds
- Enemies trigger effects when entering

**Strategic Positioning:**
- Lingering Speed II for team rally points
- Lingering Regeneration for forward operating bases
- Lingering Night Vision for cave exploration markers

### Potion Stack Management

**Inventory Optimization:**
- Splash potions don't stack with drinkable potions
- Keep splash potions in separate hotbar slots
- Label chest storage clearly: "SPLASH COMBAT", "DRINKABLE UTILITY"

**Hotbar Setup for Combat:**
```
[1] Primary Weapon
[2] Shield/Secondary
[3] Strength II Splash
[4] Instant Health II Splash
[5] Fire Resistance (if needed)
[6] Food
[7-9] situational potions
```

- Hopper to side → auto-feeds blaze powder fuel

**Setup Requirements:**
- 3 Hoppers
- 1 Brewing Stand
- 4 Chests (bottles, ingredients, fuel, output)
- Redstone comparators for monitoring

**Automation Level:** Semi-automatic (still requires player to start brewing)

### Fully Automated Brewing

**Components:**
- Multiple brewing stands in parallel
- Redstone clock for timing
- Item sorting system for ingredient management
- Storage silos for mass production

**Use Case:** Large-scale operations (dragon preparation, mass raid defense)

**Note:** See `BREWING_AUTOMATION.md` for complete automated brewing designs.

## Conclusion

Crew, brewing is both art and science. Learn your ingredients, master your sequences, and understand why each potion matters. A well-brewed potion at the right moment saves lives. A poorly brewed potion at the wrong moment gets us killed.

**The Brewing Mantra:**
> "Base first, effect second, enhance third, splash last. Order matters. Ingredients matter. Timing matters. Brew with purpose."

**Remember:**
- **Plan your brewing** - Know what you need before you start
- **Stock your ingredients** - Never brew without adequate supplies
- **Understand the sequence** - Wrong order = wasted ingredients
- **Choose enhancements wisely** - Redstone for duration, Glowstone for power
- **Think tactically** - Splash for combat, drinkable for utility

**Final Rule:**
> "When in doubt, brew Strength II splash. It solves most problems."

Now get brewing. The crew's counting on you.
