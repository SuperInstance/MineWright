## WARNING: WORKING WITH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Witches are NOT your average site personnel. These hostile mobs are armed with chemical weapons, have self-repair capabilities, and patrol in the darkest corners of your job sites. This manual will teach you how to handle witch operations safely and efficiently.

**Remember:** On a MineWright crew, we don't just survive witches—we profit from them.

## SECTION 1: WITCH BEHAVIOR - KNOW YOUR ADVERSARY

### Physical Assessment
- **Appearance:** Villager-like but wrong—purple robes, pointy hat, warty nose
- **Height:** Same as a villager (don't get cocky)
- **Threat Level:** HIGH—chemical warfare specialist

### Attack Patterns (The "Potion Protocol")

Witches don't swing swords. They throw bottles of death. Learn their projectile signatures:

| Attack Type | Effect | Detection | Countermeasure |
|-------------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Poison** | Health drain (not fatal) | Green splash particles | Wait it out, back away |
| **Instant Damage** | 6 heart damage | Dark purple splash | SHIELD immediately |
| **Slowness** | Movement reduced | Gray splash | Keep distance, bow |
| **Weakness** | Reduced damage | Gray splash | Switch to ranged |
| **Harming** | Splash damage to groups | Purple cloud | Spread out, crew! |

### Self-Repair Capability (The "Healing Factor")

**CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE:** Witches can heal themselves.

- **Trigger:** Health below 50% (5 hearts)
- **Mechanism:** Drinks potion of regeneration
- **Duration:** Up to 10 hearts recovered
- **Window of Opportunity:** While drinking, witch cannot attack
- **Crew Protocol:** ALL HANDS FIRE during healing phase

### Engagement Range
- **Throw Range:** 9 blocks (keep beyond 10 for safety)
- **Detection Range:** 16 blocks (they'll spot you first)
- **Retreat Threshold:** If you see potion bottles, you're too close

## SECTION 2: WHERE TO FIND WITCHES - SITE SURVEY

### Primary Locations

#### 1. SWAMP BIOMES (Natural Habitat)
```
Search Pattern:
- Look for dark oak trees
- Check near water (lily pads are a good sign)
- Night operations recommended (witches spawn at night)
- Foggy weather increases spawn rate
```

**Spawn Conditions:**
- Light level 7 or lower
- Grass block only
- Spawn rate: 1% of all hostile spawns in swamps

#### 2. WITCH HUTS (Structure Spawn)
- Small wooden houses (7x9 footprint)
- Only spawn in swamp biomes
- **Key Intel:** Witch can ONLY spawn inside the hut
- Roof: oak wood with spruce planks
- Contains: Crafting table, cauldron, flower pot

**Crew Note:** Clear the area around a hut before building a farm. Huts have specific spawn boundaries.

#### 3. RAIDS (Emergency Response)
- **Event:** Village raid (illager patrol triggers village attack)
- **Wave:** Witches appear in wave 4+ (hard mode)
- **Behavior:** Support role—heals other illagers, throws harmful potions
- **Loot Bonus:** Raid witches drop additional loot
- **Crew Warning:** Raids are full-site emergencies. Mobilize entire crew.

#### 4. ACCIDENTAL SPAWNS (Dark Areas)
- Anywhere light level ≤ 0
- Overworld only
- Rare compared to other hostile mobs

## SECTION 3: COMBAT TACTICS - SAFE WORK PRACTICES

### Solo Engagement Protocols

**Equipment Minimum Standards:**
- Protection IV armor or equivalent
- Shield (Mandatory for melee)
- Bow (Power III recommended)
- At least 2 stacks of arrows
- Golden apple (emergency ration)

#### The Shield-and-Strike Method
```
1. Approach to 6-block distance
2. Hold shield (right-click)
3. Wait for potion throw
4. Drop shield, strike immediately
5. Re-raise shield before next throw
6. Repeat until target neutralized
```

**Pro Tip:** Timing is everything. Witches have a "cooldown" between throws. Learn the rhythm.

#### The Kiting Technique
```
1. Maintain 10-12 block distance
2. Use bow exclusively
3. Strafe sideways (don't back up—slower movement)
4. Predict throw trajectory (they lead their target)
5. Critical hits on every shot
```

**Crew Advantage:** Ranged combat eliminates splash damage risk.

### Weakness Exploitation

**Fire Damage (The "Burn Protocol"):**
- Witches take 25% more fire damage
- Lava buckets are highly effective
- Flint and steel for emergency crowd control
- Fire aspect weapons add bonus damage

**Falling Damage (The "Gravity Trap"):**
- Witches take normal fall damage
- Build elevated platforms around farms
- Trapdoors+water for controlled drops
- 23-block drop = fatal (23 heart damage)

### Defensive Measures

**Cover Construction:**
- Build 2-block high barriers
- Use glass walls for visibility with protection
- Overhangs block splash potions (they explode on impact)
- Water streams slow witch movement

**Potion Protection (Advanced):**
- Drink potions of Fire Resistance before engagement
- Potions of Speed for kiting advantage
- Potions of Strength for melee crew members

## SECTION 4: WITCH DROPS - MATERIAL RECOVERY

### Standard Drop Table

| Material | Drop Rate | Quantity | Usage |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Glowstone Dust** | 100% | 0-2 | Brewing, light |
| **Redstone Dust** | 100% | 0-2 | Redstone, brewing |
| **Sugar** | 100% | 0-2 | Speed potions, cake |
| **Spider Eye** | 100% | 0-2 | Poison potions |
| **Glass Bottle** | 100% | 0-2 | Water bottles |
| **Gunpowder** | 100% | 0-2 | Splash potions |
| **Potions** | Variable | 1 | Drinkable potion |

### Potion Drop Analysis

When killed, witches may drop the potion they're holding:

**Common Drops:**
- Potion of Healing (Instant health)
- Potion of Fire Resistance
- Potion of Swiftness
- Potion of Water Breathing

**Economic Impact:** A single witch can drop materials worth:
- Glowstone: 4 emeralds (villager trading)
- Redstone: 2 emeralds
- Gunpowder: 1-2 emeralds
- **Total per witch:** 7-10 emeralds equivalent

**Looting Enchantment Bonus:**
- Looting I: +1 per drop type
- Looting II: +2 per drop type
- Looting III: +3 per drop type
- **Crew Recommendation:** Always use Looting III swords

## SECTION 5: WITCH HUTS - STRUCTURE ASSESSMENT

### Architectural Analysis

**Exterior Dimensions:**
- Footprint: 7×9 blocks
- Height: 5 blocks (walls) + 3 blocks (roof)
- Foundation: Wooden beams (oak)
- Siding: Spruce planks

**Interior Layout:**
- Single room (5×7 interior space)
- Workstation: Crafting table
- Brewing equipment: Cauldron (usually empty)
- Decoration: Flower pot with red mushroom
- Spawn area: Center 7×9×7 volume

### Spawn Mechanics (The "Hut Boundary")

**CRITICAL ENGINEERING DATA:**

Witch huts have a defined spawn box:
- **Horizontal:** 7×9 blocks (hut footprint)
- **Vertical:** From ground level to one block above roof
- **Spawn block:** Must be grass block
- **Requirement:** Light level ≤ 7 inside hut

**Farming Implications:**
- Any block modification inside spawn box can disable spawning
- DO NOT place torches inside the hut
- DO NOT replace floor blocks
- Roof modifications are safe (spawn box stops below roof)

### Hut Conversion to Farm

**Phase 1: Site Preparation**
```
1. Clear 100-block radius of all hostile mobs
2. Light up surrounding area (not the hut)
3. Build containment platform (optional)
```

**Phase 2: Transport System**
```
1. Build water canal from hut door to collection point
2. Use signs to control water flow
3. Create holding cell for sorting
4. Install kill mechanism or transport to AFK zone
```

**Phase 3: Optimization**
```
1. Remove all floor blocks except spawn pad
2. Replace with 1×1 grass platform (center only)
3. Build drop shaft below spawn point
4. Install trapdoor system (witches trigger trapdoors)
```

**Production Rate:**
- Unoptimized hut: 1-2 witches per hour
- Basic farm: 10-15 witches per hour
- Advanced farm: 40-60 witches per hour
- **Maximum theoretical:** 120 witches per hour (portal-novelty design)

## SECTION 6: WITCH FARMS - PRODUCTION LINES

### Farm Classifications

#### Tier 1: Natural Hut Farm
**Complexity:** Low
**Yield:** 10-15 witches/hour
**Resources Required:**
- Basic building materials (wood, stone)
- Water buckets (4-8)
- Hopper system (optional)

**Construction Steps:**
1. Locate witch hut in swamp
2. Build 2-block high wall around hut (prevent escape)
3. Dig canal from door to collection point
4. Install water flow
5. Create kill room or transport tunnel

**Advantage:** Uses natural spawn mechanics
**Disadvantage:** Limited to witch hut location

#### Tier 2: Spawn Platform Farm
**Complexity:** Medium
**Yield:** 20-30 witches/hour
**Resources Required:**
- Slime blocks (honey/coal for piston automation)
- Minecarts and rails (for transport)
- Redstone comparators (for detection)

**Design Principle:**
Witches require grass blocks to spawn. Build platforms of grass in dark swamp areas.

**Construction Steps:**
1. Find swamp biome (minimum 64×64 blocks)
2. Build multi-level spawning platforms (2-3 levels)
3. Space platforms 4 blocks apart vertically
4. Use trapdoors for "edge detection" pushing
5. Water transport to central collection

**Advantage:** Scalable, movable to convenient location
**Disadvantage:** Requires significant surface area

#### Tier 3: Raid Farm (The "Industrial Solution")
**Complexity:** HIGH
**Yield:** 100+ witches/hour
**Resources Required:**
- Village components (beds, workstations)
- Raid triggering mechanism (pillager captain)
- EXTENSIVE redstone circuitry
- Cat/go Pens (for villager safety)

**How It Works:**
1. Trigger raid in controlled environment
2. Lure witches into kill chamber
3. Reset raid (remove bad omen)
4. Repeat

**WARNING:** Raid farms can destroy entire villages if built incorrectly. Requires expert redstone knowledge.

**Advantage:** Highest yield, fastest production
**Disadvantage:** Complex build, high maintenance

### AFK Farming Strategies

**The "Idle Production" Method:**
- AFK at spawn point (Y=128 or higher)
- Witch despawn range: 128 blocks
- Keep chunk loaded with name tag or player presence
- Use alt account or AFK pool

**The "Macro-Management" Approach:**
- Check farm every 30 minutes
- Empty collection hoppers
- Reset any stuck witches
- Sort materials into brewing stations

## SECTION 7: LOOTING RUNS - RESOURCE EXTRACTION

### Swamp Sweep Operations

**Mission:** Locate and clear witch hut, collect immediate loot, mark for future farming.

**Equipment Checklist:**
- [ ] Iron or better armor (Protection II minimum)
- [ ] Sword with Looting III
- [ ] Shield (mandatory)
- [ ] Bow (Power I minimum)
- [ ] 2 stacks arrows
- [ ] Food (20+ units)
- [ ] Torches (2 stacks) for lighting path
- [ ] Boat (swamp travel)
- [ ] Map and compass

**Operating Procedure:**
```
1. Enter swamp biome at dawn
2. Navigate by boat (faster, safer)
3. Spot witch hut from distance (use spyglass)
4. Approach from upwind (they can smell your fear)
5. Clear area 50 blocks around hut
6. Engage witch with ranged attacks first
7. Collect loot immediately (despawn risk)
8. Mark hut location (coordinates, nuke)
9. Light path for return trip
10. Report to crew for farm construction
```

**Safety Protocols:**
- NEVER engage witch at night unless necessary
- Always have escape route planned
- If health drops below 50%, RETREAT
- Swamps have slimes—expect multi-threat engagement

### Raid Participation (The "Emergency Crew")

**When Village Raid Triggered:**

**Phase 1: Assessment**
- Determine raid wave (check boss bar)
- Identify witch presence
- Survey village perimeter
- Establish fallback position

**Phase 2: Positioning**
- Take high ground (rooftops)
- Protect villagers (they're your bonus)
- Cover iron golem (primary tank)
- Designate witch target caller

**Phase 3: Engagement**
- Eliminate other raiders first (villagers, evokers)
- Focus fire on witches last (they heal allies)
- Use shield to block splash potions
- Collect witch drops immediately (they despawn fast in raids)

**Phase 4: Recovery**

## SECTION 9: POTION ECONOMY - THE BOTTOM LINE

### The Strategic Value of Witches

**Why We Care:**

Witches are the ONLY renewable source of several critical brewing materials. In a MineWright operation, potions are not optional—they're essential for:

1. **Night Vision Operations** - Mining at Y=-60 without light pollution
2. **Fire Resistance** - Nether expeditions, strider riding
3. **Speed Runs** - Long-distance travel, courier missions
4. **Combat Readiness** - Strength potions for boss fights
5. **Emergency Medicine** - Healing potions save lives

### Material Flow Analysis

**Input (Witch Farm Production):**
- Glowstone dust → Potion of Strength (2 dust)
- Redstone dust → Extended potions (duration boost)
- Spider eye → Potion of Poison (2 eyes)
- Sugar → Potion of Swiftness (1 sugar)
- Gunpowder → Splash conversion (1 gunpowder)
- Glass bottles → Potion base (unlimited)

**Output (Finished Potions):**
| Potion | Ingredients | Market Value | Usage Frequency |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Healing II | Glistering melon | HIGH | Combat |
| Strength II | Blaze rod + glowstone | VERY HIGH | Boss fights |
| Swiftness II | Sugar + glowstone | Medium | Travel |
| Fire Resistance | Magma cream | HIGH | Nether |
| Poison II | Spider eye + glowstone | Low | PvP |
| Harming II | Fermented spider eye + glowstone | Medium | PvP |

**Profit Calculation:**
```
Per Witch (Looting III):
- Glowstone: 2-5 dust
- Redstone: 2-5 dust
- Sugar: 2-5 units
- Spider eye: 2-5 units
- Gunpowder: 2-5 units
- Glass bottles: 2-5 units

Brewing Conversion:
- 1 witch ≈ 3-5 Strength II potions
- 1 witch ≈ 5-8 Fire Resistance potions
- 1 witch ≈ 4-6 Swiftness II potions

Crew Revenue:
- 1 hour witch farming (Tier 2 farm) = 30 witches
- 30 witches = ~120 Strength II potions
- Market value = 120 × 12 emeralds = 1,440 emeralds/hour
```

**Bottom Line:** A well-run witch operation is the most profitable activity on a MineWright job site.

### Integration with Other Operations

**With Nether Team:**
- Blaze rods from Nether Fortress
- Magma cream from Magma Cube farm
- Combine with witch materials for full potion catalog

**With Mining Team:**
- Nether wart from Nether fortress
- Glistering melon from gold mining
- Potion of Healing for cave operations

**With Farming Team:**
- Spider eyes from spider farm
- Rabbit's foot from rabbit farm
- Leaping potions for vertical mobility

## CREW TALK DIALOGUES

### CREW TALK #1: The New Hire Orientation

**FOREMAN JIM:** "Alright kid, listen close. You see that purple-robed freak over there? That's a witch. Not to be confused with the villagers we trade with. Witches'll kill you soon as look at you."
**NEW HIRE STEVE:** "She's just throwing bottles, Jim. How bad can it be?"
**FOREMAN JIM:** "That bottle? That's six hearts of 'you done messed up.' And if you think that's bad, wait 'til she starts drinking her own supply. She heals up faster than you can say 'I need a medic.' Now pick up your shield and get to work."
**NEW HIRE STEVE:** "Yes sir. Hey, why's she wearing a pointy hat anyway?"
**FOREMAN JIM:** "Same reason you wear a hard hat, kid. Safety first. Now let's move."

### CREW TALK #2: The Raid Emergency

**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "All units, this is not a drill. Raid in progress at Village Delta. Wave count is four and climbing."
**TANK BIG DAVE:** "I've got a golem down! Need a revive, stat!"
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Medic, get in there. DPS, what's your status?"
**RANGER SARAH:** "I count three witches, Maria. They're healing the other raiders. This is a nightmare."
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Focus fire on the witches first. If we don't cut off their support, we lose the village. Dave, hold the line. Help is coming."
**TANK BIG DAVE:** "I don't know how long I can—wait, is that a potion of Strength I see?"
**RANGER SARAH:** "Drink up, Dave. We got you covered."

### CREW TALK #3: The Farm Construction

**ARCHITECT TOM:** "Alright crew, here's the blueprint. We're building a three-tier witch farm with canal transport and AFK collection."
**BUILDER BEN:** "Tom, you want us to flood the swamp? That's gonna take a lot of water buckets."
**ARCHITECT TOM:** "Not flood, Ben. Irrigation. We're gonna guide those witches right to where we want 'em. Think of it as... herding."
**BUILDER BEN:** "I've herded sheep before, Tom. Sheep don't throw poison at you."
**ARCHITECT TOM:** "Just build the canals, Ben. I've done the math. With this design, we're looking at forty witches per hour. That's a lot of glowstone."
**BUILDER BEN:** "Forty witches worth of glowstone. Alright, you win. Pass the dirt."

### CREW TALK #4: The Supply Chain Crisis

**QUARTERMASTER LISA:** "We're out of gunpowder, people! How are we supposed to make splash potions without gunpowder?"
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Creeper farm is down for maintenance. We're running on reserves."
**QUARTERMASTER LISA:** "Reserves aren't gonna cut it. The Nether team needs Fire Resistance for the Bastion run tomorrow. We're talking twenty-two operators."
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Can we get it from witches?"
**QUARTERMASTER LISA:** "Witches drop gunpowder? Since when?"
**ARCHITECT TOM:** "Always have. It's just not... reliable. One witch might give you three gunpowder, might give you zero. It's a gamble."
**QUARTERMASTER LISA:** "Well, start gambling, Tom. We need a hundred units by tomorrow morning."
**ARCHITECT TOM:** "I'll fire up the witch farm. We're gonna be here all night, aren't we?"

### CREW TALK #5: The After-Action Report

**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Alright, let's debrief. Delta Village raid. What went wrong?"
**TANK BIG DAVE:** "We weren't ready for the witches. I'd never seen them heal that fast. It was like they had a respawn point right next to us."
**RANGER SARAH:** "They were healing the ravagers, Maria. I saw a ravager at two hearts, then suddenly it's back to full health. The witch just kept chugging potions."
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "And our response?"
**MEDIC JEN:** "We didn't prioritize targets. Should've taken out the witches first. I kept trying to heal Dave, but the splash damage was too much."
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Lesson learned. From now on, witches are alpha priority. If you see a witch, you call it out. Is that clear?"
**ALL:** "Clear."
**CREW LEAD MARIA:** "Good. Now get some rest. Tomorrow we start building that witch farm. We're never getting caught with our pants down again."
