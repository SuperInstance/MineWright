## FOREWORD

Listen up, crew. When you're working below the waterline, the ocean tries to kill you three different ways before lunch. Drowning, darkness, and hostile mobs - that's the underwater trifecta. But you know what beats all three? A properly built conduit frame.

This manual ain't suggestions. It's procedures. Follow them, you come back to the surface with the job done. Cut corners, you become part of the reef.

Read it. Learn it. Live it.

## 1. WHAT'S A CONDUIT

### The Basics

A conduit is a beacon-type block that provides powerful underwater effects to all nearby players and agents. Think of it as your underwater life support system - creates a bubble of civilization in the middle of hostile ocean.

### What It Does

**Conduit Power Effect:**
- Unlimited underwater breathing (no air bar)
- Improved underwater mining speed (same as on land)
- Night vision underwater

This stacks with existing potions and equipment. Combined with Depth Strider boots, you're basically working on dry land.

### Range Coverage

| Frame Level | Prismarine Required | Range (Blocks) | Coverage Area |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Level 1 (Minimum) | 16 blocks | 32 blocks | 2,050 blocks² |
| Level 2 | 30 blocks | 42 blocks | 5,540 blocks² |
| Level 3 | 42 blocks | 50 blocks | 7,850 blocks² |
| Level 4 (Full) | 70 blocks | 96 blocks | 28,940 blocks² |

**Rule of thumb:** Full frame gives you nearly 100-block range. That's a circle covering 9 chunks from center to edge.

### Why It Matters

**Operational Benefits:**
- Extended dive times without surfacing
- Combat effectiveness against ocean hosts
- Mining speed at deep ocean monuments
- Base construction without air pockets
- Salvage operations on shipwrecks

**Economic Impact:** A working conduit frame pays for itself in the first major underwater operation. Time saved not managing air logistics = more productive shifts.

---

## 2. MATERIALS NEEDED

### Core Component

**Heart of the Sea** (1 required)
- Rare loot from buried treasure
- Only way to craft the conduit itself
- No substitutes, no workarounds

**Crafting Recipe:**
```
Nautilus Shell (8) in ring pattern
Heart of Sea (1) in center
= Conduit (1)
```

### Frame Materials

**Acceptable Block Types:**
- **Prismarine** (standard block from sea temples)
- **Prismarine Bricks** ( crafted from prismarine shards )
- **Dark Prismarine** (crafted with prismarine crystals + ink sacs)
- **Sea Lanterns** (light-emitting, counts as prismarine)

**Frame Requirements:**
- Minimum: 16 prismarine blocks (any type)
- Full frame: 70 prismarine blocks
- Must be connected to center conduit
- Must form valid frame pattern (see Section 4)

### Nautilus Shells

**Required:** 8 shells for conduit crafting
**Optional:** Extra shells for trading with clerics

**Sources:**
- Drowned drops (common)
- Fishing (rare)
- Purchased from wandering traders (expensive)

---

## 3. FINDING MATERIALS

### Heart of the Sea Acquisition

**Buried Treasure Maps:**
1. Find shipwreck or underwater ruins
2. Locate map chest
3. Follow buried treasure map
4. Dig at marked location (always beach/sand)
5. Open treasure chest

**Success Rate:** 100% if you follow the map correctly. The Heart is guaranteed loot in buried treasure.

**CREW TALK:**

> **Salty:** "Another treasure map, Boss. That's the third one this week."
>
> **Foreman:** "Keep 'em coming, Salty. Every Heart is a crew that doesn't drown."
>
> **Salty:** "What's the count now?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Sixteen active conduits in the fleet. We're running operations from deep ocean to coral reefs. Nobody else can work that deep."
>
> **Salty:** "Remember when we did air pockets? Had to come up every two minutes?"
>
> **Foreman:** "We don't talk about the old days, Salty. We don't talk about the crews we lost."

### Nautilus Shell Farming

**Drowned Farming:**
- Build drowned farm in river biome (2x2 water pool)
- Use flow mechanics to push drowned into kill chamber
- Collect drops with hopper system
- Expected yield: 1 shell per 50-100 drowned

**Ocean Ruins Farming:**
- Locate ocean ruin clusters
- Mine every suspicious gravel block
- Natural drowned spawns supplement drops
- Better yields but more dangerous

**Fishing:**
- AFK fishing farm
- Low shell rate (~1% per catch)
- Only recommended as supplement

**CREW TALK:**

> **Rookie:** "How many shells we need, Boss?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Eight for the conduit. Forty for the backup stock. Another hundred for the winter season."
>
> **Rookie:** "That's a lot of drowned."
>
> **Foreman:** "That's why we built the farm, kid. Two shifts cycling through. You're on night shift."
>
> **Rookie:** "What's the expected yield per shift?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Don't count yields, count shifts. Farmed every day for three months, that's how many shells we have. You want numbers, check the ledger. You want shells, work the farm."

### Prismarine Acquisition

**Ocean Monument Raiding:**
- Requires preparation (potions, gear, tactics)
- Mining prismarine from monument structure
- Each monument: 200-400 prismarine blocks
- **WARNING:** Elder guardians inflict Mining Fatigue III

**Effective Mining Strategy:**
1. Clear monument of guardians (kill chamber design)
2. Remove elder guardians (combat tunnel approach)
3. Mine prismarine systematically (start from top)
4. Sea lanterns are fair game (lighting + frame material)
5. Leave structure intact for potential guardian farm

**CREW TALK:**

> **DeepDive:** "That's a big monument, Boss. Elder count?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Three. Standard setup. We clear them, we mine the place clean."
>
> **DeepDive:** "What's the prize?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Eight conduits worth of prismarine. Plus sponge, plus gold, plus whatever else we strip."
>
> **DeepDive:** "When do we start?"
>
> **Foreman:** "You're on point. Take a team in tomorrow. We need that frame material before the deep trench operation."

## 4. CONDUIT FRAME CONSTRUCTION

### Frame Pattern Requirements

The conduit frame must form a valid 3D structure around the center conduit. Think of it as building a cage with specific architectural requirements.

**Valid Frame Rules:**
1. All prismarine blocks must be within 5 blocks of center
2. Frame must enclose the conduit on at least 4 sides (not necessarily 6)
3. Blocks can be any prismarine type (mixed is fine)
4. Frame must be connected (no floating sections)
5. Conduit goes in center after frame is built

### Standard Frame Designs

**Minimum Frame (Level 1):**
- 16 prismarine blocks
- Simple cage around conduit
- Range: 32 blocks
- Use: Temporary operations, budget builds

**Standard Frame (Level 2):**
- 30 prismarine blocks
- Extended cage with corners
- Range: 42 blocks
- Use: Regular operations, most bases

**Full Frame (Level 4):**
- 70 prismarine blocks
- Complete octahedron shape
- Range: 96 blocks (maximum)
- Use: Permanent installations, major operations

**Construction Pattern (Full Frame):**

```

### Building Procedure

**Step 1: Site Preparation**
- Clear area of debris and mobs
- Place temporary lighting (torches, sea lanterns)
- Mark center point with temporary block
- Verify water depth (minimum 5 blocks vertical space)

**Step 2: Frame Construction**
- Start from bottom layer and build up
- Use scaffold blocks for difficult placements
- Double-check pattern matches design
- Count blocks as you place (70 for full frame)
- Leave center empty for conduit placement

**Step 3: Conduit Installation**
- Place conduit in center position
- Conduit activates immediately if frame is valid
- Verify activation (eye opens, beams emit)
- Remove scaffold blocks

**Step 4: Finalization**
- Add permanent lighting around frame
- Create access ladder/stairway
- Mark boundary with buoys or beacons
- Log in operations ledger

---

## 5. ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

### Activation Checklist

**Before Placing Conduit:**
- [ ] Frame completed (correct block count)
- [ ] Frame pattern verified (valid structure)
- [ ] Area cleared of hostile mobs
- [ ] Lighting installed for safety
- [ ] Access route established
- [ ] Crew briefed on operation

**After Placing Conduit:**
- [ ] Conduit eye opens (visual confirmation)
- [ ] Beams emit from conduit (light show)
- [ ] Conduit Power effect received
- [ ] Range verified (96 blocks for full frame)
- [ ] Area marked on maps
- [ ] Logged in operations ledger

### Activation Levels

**What Determines Level:**
- Number of prismarine blocks in frame
- Validity of frame structure
- Proper connection to center conduit

**Quick Reference:**
- 16 blocks = Level 1 (32 block range)
- 30 blocks = Level 2 (42 block range)
- 42 blocks = Level 3 (50 block range)
- 70 blocks = Level 4 (96 block range, MAXIMUM)

**CREW TALK:**

> **Sparky:** "Boss, I built the frame, but it's not activating!"
>
> **Foreman:** "Block count, Sparky."
>
> **Sparky:** "Sixty-eight. I used every prismarine we had."
>
> **Foreman:** "That's your problem right there. Minimum's seventy for full activation."
>
> **Sparky:** "What's it doing now?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Partial activation. Level 3. Fifty block range. Not bad, but not full power."
>
> **Sparky:** "So we need two more blocks?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Two more prismarine, or two sea lanterns from the monument. Your call."
>
> **Sparky:** "I'm heading back to the monument."
>
> **Foreman:** "Take a guard. Ocean monuments don't forgive mistakes."

### Verification Testing

**Range Test Procedure:**
1. Mark conduit center with temporary block
2. Swim outward in cardinal directions (N, S, E, W)
3. Mark where Conduit Power effect ends
4. Verify measured range matches expected range
5. Record any discrepancies

**Effect Test Procedure:**
1. Dive to bottom of operational area
2. Verify breathing (no air bar usage)
3. Test mining speed on standard block
4. Check night vision activation
5. Report any anomalies

## 6. UNDERWATER BASE BUILDING

### Site Selection

**Ideal Conduit Base Locations:**
- Deep ocean biome (maximum depth, maximum space)
- Near ocean monument (guardian farm potential)
- Adjacent to coral reef (aesthetic + resources)
- Close to shore (logistics easier)
- Avoid ocean ruins (can interfere with building)

**Depth Considerations:**
- Shallow (<20 blocks): Easy access, limited space
- Medium (20-40 blocks): Good balance
- Deep (40+ blocks): Maximum privacy, harder logistics

### Base Integration

**Conduit Placement Strategy:**
1. **Central Hub:** Place conduit in center of base
2. **Multiple Conduits:** Overlap ranges for large bases
3. **Mobile Operations:** Build temporary frames for projects
4. **Surface Access:** Place conduit near water elevator

**Power Distribution:**
- Conduit power passes through walls
- No line-of-sight required
- Effect continues through any block
- Range is spherical from center conduit

### Construction Techniques

**Underwater Building Methods:**

**Method 1: Air Pocket**
- Place door or signs to create air pocket
- Build in dry space
- Remove temporary blocks
- **Pro:** Standard building
- **Con:** Time-consuming, limited scale

**Method 2: Scaffold Drop**
- Build structure on surface
- Drop into place with sand/gravel
- Remove scaffold from bottom
- **Pro:** Fast for simple structures
- **Con:** Complex shapes difficult

**Method 3: Direct Placement (Conduit Power)**
- Build directly underwater with conduit active
- Normal mining speed makes this viable
- **Pro:** Maximum flexibility
- **Con:** Requires conduit first

**CREW TALK:**

> **Mason:** "Underwater building without conduit power is slow work, Boss."
>
> **Foreman:** "How slow?"
>
> **Mason:** "Three times slower than on land. And that's with Aqua Affinity."
>
> **Foreman:** "And with the conduit?"
>
> **Mason:** "Like working on land. I built the whole outer shell yesterday once the frame went up."
>
> **Foreman:** "That's why we build the frame first. Always the frame first."
>
> **Mason:** "What about the interior?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Frame goes up today, you start interior tomorrow. We're on schedule."

### Base Security

**Hostile Mob Prevention:**
- Conduit frame prevents regular drowned spawns
- Light up area with sea lanterns
- Use doors/fence gates to prevent entrance
- Consider secondary barriers for high-value areas

**Guest Protocol:**
- All visitors briefed on conduit range
- Emergency surfacing points marked
- Extra conduit frames on standby
- Rescue divers stationed during operations

## 7. COMBAT TACTICS

### Conduit Combat Advantage

**What Changes:**
- Unlimited breathing = extended underwater combat
- Night vision = target acquisition
- Mining speed = barrier creation/destruction
- No air management = full attention on combat

**Against Drowned:**
- Fight them on their territory without penalty
- Mine defensive positions quickly
- Pursue fleeing targets indefinitely
- Zero drowning risk

**Against Guardians:**
- Extended raids on ocean monuments
- Combat without surfacing
- Barrier mining for tactical positioning
- Extended looting operations

### Combat Formations

**The Diving Bell:**
- Conduit at center
- Crew within 20 blocks
- Guarded perimeter
- Emergency retreat to center

**The Push:**
- Advance conduit frame forward
- Progressive capture of territory
- Build new frames, abandon old
- Used for large-scale clearing

**The Ambush:**
- Hide conduit frame
- Lure enemies into range
- Activate, attack, destroy
- Psychological warfare

**CREW TALK:**

> **Guard:** "Six drowned incoming from the trench, Boss!"
>
> **Foreman:** "Conduit status?"
>
> **Guard:** "Green! Full power! We're clear to engage!"
>
> **Foreman:** "Form up around the frame. Masons, barrier the rear. Guards, forward!"
>
> **Guard:** "They've got tridents!"
>
> **Foreman:** "We've got unlimited air and they don't. Press the advantage!"
>
> **Guard:** "They're breaking off!"
>
> **Foreman:** "Let them run. We're not here to exterminate, we're here to work."

## 8. TEAM OCEAN PROJECTS

### Multiple Conduit Coordination

**When to Use Multiple Conduits:**
- Large-scale underwater construction
- Multiple operation sites
- Redundancy for critical operations
- Extended territorial control

**Overlap Strategy:**
- Place conduits 80 blocks apart
- Creates continuous coverage
- Seamless transition between zones
- Redundancy if one fails

### Division of Labor

**Frame Team (3-4 workers):**
- Gather prismarine from monuments
- Construct conduit frames
- Install and test activation
- Maintenance and repair

**Operations Team (5-8 workers):**
- Conduct underwater operations
- Build bases and structures
- Resource gathering
- Combat and security

**Support Team (2-3 workers):**
- Surface logistics
- Supply distribution
- Emergency response
- Communications

### Large Build Coordination

**Spatial Partitioning:**
- Divide build area into sections
- Each team works in their section
- Conduit range defines section boundaries
- Coordinate at section boundaries

**Phased Construction:**
1. Phase 1: Place conduit frames
2. Phase 2: Build outer shell
3. Phase 3: Install interior
4. Phase 4: Detail and finish

**Progress Report Format:**
```
Sector: A7
Conduit: Active
Team: Mason crew
Progress: Outer shell 80%
Issues: None
Next: Interior walls
```

**CREW TALK:**

> **Foreman:** "Listen up! We're building the Great Reef Arena. This is the biggest underwater project the company has ever attempted."
>
> **Crew:** (quiet)
>
> **Foreman:** "Three conduit frames. Twenty-five workers. Six-month timeline. We're building an entire stadium underwater."
>
> **DeepDive:** "What's the conduit spacing?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Eighty blocks. Overlapping coverage. No dead zones. If a conduit goes down, the others keep the zone alive."
>
> **Sparky:** "Who's building the frames?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Frame Team goes in first. You have two weeks to get all three activated. Operations Team can't start until the site is safe."
>
> **Mason:** "What are we building first?"
>
> **Foreman:** "The outer wall. Two blocks thick, prismarine all the way. Once it's sealed, we fill the interior and drain the sections."
>
> **DeepDive:** "Like a ship in a bottle."
>
> **Foreman:** "Exactly. We build the bottle, then we build the ship. Questions?"
>
> **Crew:** "No questions, Boss."
>
> **Foreman:** "Then get to work. We're making history."

## 9. TROUBLESHOOTING

### Conduit Won't Activate

**Check Frame:**
- Block count (minimum 16 for Level 1)
- Pattern validity (must form cage)
- Block types (prismarine variants only)
- Connection to center

**Common Issues:**
- Missing blocks (count again)
- Invalid pattern (rebuild)
- Wrong block type (replace)
- Not connected (fix structure)

**CREW TALK:**

> **Rookie:** "Boss, the conduit won't activate. I built the frame exactly like the manual."
>
> **Foreman:** "Block count?"
>
> **Rookie:** "Seventy. I counted twice."
>
> **Foreman:** "Frame pattern?"
>
> **Rookie:** "Standard full frame. I followed the blueprint."
>
> **Foreman:** "What blocks did you use?"
>
> **Rookie:** "Mostly prismarine, but I used some regular prismarine bricks for the corners."
>
> **Foreman:** "Regular prismarine bricks aren't frame blocks, Rookie. Only dark prismarine and sea lantern variants work."
>
> **Rookie:** "I have to rebuild the whole thing?"
>
> **Foreman:** "Just swap out the wrong blocks. Consider it a lesson learned the easy way."

### Intermittent Activation

**Possible Causes:**
- Chunk loading/unloading
- Frame block removal (accidental)
- Server lag
- Concurrent modification

**Solutions:**
- Stay within chunk boundary
- Protect frame with barriers
- Use chunk loader for critical conduits
- Report to admin if persistent

### Reduced Range

**Investigation:**
1. Measure actual range
2. Compare to expected range
3. Count frame blocks
4. Check for missing blocks
5. Verify activation level

**Restoration:**
- Replace missing blocks
- Complete partial frames
- Verify full activation

### Emergency Procedures

**Conduit Failure:**
1. **Immediately:** Sound emergency alarm
2. **All Crew:** Surface or nearest air pocket
3. **Frame Team:** Assess damage
4. **Support Team:** Prepare backup frame
5. **Foreman:** Make call - repair or abandon

**Crew Safety First:**
- No heroics underwater
- Abandon operations if unsafe
- Backup frames for critical operations
- Regular safety drills
