# WOODLAND MANSION OPERATIONS - Crew Manual

**MineWright Heavy Operations Division**

---

## FOREWORD

Listen up, crew. Woodland mansions ain't your everyday job site. We're talking about the biggest, nastiest naturally-generated structure in the Overworld. Three floors of illager-infested nightmare, packed with more hostile mobs per block than anywhere else in the game.

But here's the thing: the payout's worth it. Totems of Undying, allays, rare loot, and a headquarters you can convert into base ops. This is high-risk, high-reward work.

Your attention's gonna be split across dozens of rooms, multiple floors, and hostile mobs that don't quit. The vector DB's got mansion layouts if you need reference, but nothing beats hands-on experience.

This manual's your blueprint. Study it before you step foot on the property.

## 1. FINDING MANSIONS - THE HUNT

### BIOME LOCATION

**Exclusive Spawn:** Dark Oak Forest biome (and its variants)

**Identification Markers:**
- Dark oak trees (thick trunks, 2x2)
- Large mushrooms (red and brown)
- Grass color: dark green-tinted
- Huge mushroom structures common
- Birch trees nearby (sometimes)

**Search Pattern:**
- Mansions spawn thousands of blocks apart
- Travel in a straight line from spawn
- Use maps to track explored territory
- Look for biome clusters - dark oak forests are rare

### EXPLORATION METHODS

**Method A: Cartographer Trade (Recommended)**
- Find a village cartographer
- Level them up to apprentice
- Buy "Woodland Explorer Map" for 14 emeralds + compass
- Map shows mansion location within 10,000 blocks
- Follow the marker - simple, reliable

**Method B: Boat Expedition**
- Build a boat at a large ocean
- Follow coastlines until you find dark oak forest
- Faster than walking, covers more ground
- Bring supplies for extended journey

**Method C: Nether Roof Travel (Advanced)**
- Build to nether roof (y=127)
- Travel 1 block in nether = 8 blocks overworld
- Use F3 coordinates to navigate
- Faster but dangerous if you fall

**Method D: Command Search (If Server Allows)**
```
/locate structure minecraft:woodland_mansion
```
- Gives exact coordinates
- Teleport there if `/tp` is enabled
- Not available on most survival servers

### MANSION RARITY

**Spawn Rate:** ~1 mansion per 20,000 x 20,000 block area

**World Border Considerations:**
- Limited world size = fewer mansions
- Infinite worlds = always one somewhere
- Use maps to track search sectors

**Distance Estimates:**
- Average distance from spawn: 10,000-20,000 blocks
- Closest possible: ~1,000 blocks (rare)
- Furthest practical: 50,000+ blocks

---

## 5. VALUABLE LOOT - THE PAYDAY

### TOTEM OF UNDYING

**What It Does:**
- Automatically activates when taking fatal damage
- Prevents death, heals to 1 heart
- Gives Absorption II (extra health)
- Gives Regeneration II (healing)
- One-time use per totem

**Drop Source:**

- Rare from other illager sources

**Why It's Gold:**
- Best item in game for survival
- Allows risky plays with insurance
- Stackable for multiple lives
- Trading value: extremely high

**Collection Protocol:**
- Kill evoker yourself (not wolves/iron golems)
- Pick up totem IMMEDIATELY
- Put in off-hand slot
- Never leave without collecting

**Usage Tips:**
- Off-hand slot = auto-activate
- Works with any fatal damage
- Void death? Saved.
- Wither explosion? Saved.
- Five creepers? Probably saved.

**Crew Talk:**
> "That's three totems from this mansion. Our survival probability just increased by a factor of ten."

### ALLAYS

**What They Do:**
- Collect dropped items
- Follow you around
- Deposit items into note blocks
- adorable blue flying buddies

**How to Find:**
- Look for oak cages
- Break cage with hand or tool
- Allay will start following you
- Brown and white varieties

**Taming Protocol:**
- Give allay any item
- It will collect more of that item
- Bring to note block
- Allay deposits items there
- Now it's "tamed" to that location

**Why They're Valuable:**
- Auto-sorting farms
- Drop collection systems
- Adorable factor = immeasurable
- Rare mob (only in mansions)

**Usage Ideas:**
- Crop farm collection
- Mob drop pickup
- Storage room organization
- Building material gathering

**Crew Talk:**
> "Found two allays in the bedroom. Gonna deploy 'em to the wheat farm - they'll handle the harvest collection."

### CHEST LOOT

**Common Loot:**

- Share with crew evenly
- Check EVERY chest (some are hidden)

### MANSION-EXCLUSIVE LOOT

**Diamond Blocks (Altar Room):**
- Usually 2-8 blocks
- Mine with silk touch or iron pick+
- 9 diamonds per block
- Worth the evoker fight

**Allays:**
- Only spawn in mansions
- Limited number per mansion
- Not renewable
- HIGH VALUE

**Experience:**
- Vindicators: 5 XP each
- Evokers: 10 XP each
- Vindicators = XP farm potential
- Full mansion clear = 30-50 levels

## 6. ALLAY RESCUE - EXTRACTION PROTOCOL

### LOCATING ALLAYS

**Where to Look:**
- Second floor bedrooms (most common)
- Cages made of oak fences
- Listen for unique allay sounds
- Look through windows from corridors
- Brown and white varieties

**Identification:**
- Small, blue, flying creature
- Holding an item (usually nothing)
- Trapped inside 1x1 cage
- Spinning animation when idle

### EXTRACTION PROCESS

**STEP 1: CLEAR ROOM**
- Kill all hostile mobs first
- Check corners for vindicators
- Verify evokers are dead
- Allays can't wait while you fight

**STEP 2: APPROACH CAGE**
- Crouch to avoid breaking accidentally
- Note which way allay is facing
- Plan exit route
- Have item ready to give

**STEP 3: BREAK CAGE**
- Break any fence block
- Allay will start following you
- Give it any item immediately
- It will collect more of that item

**STEP 4: EXTRACTION**
- Walk back to base safely
- Allay follows at walking speed
- Can teleport if far away
- Don't leave it behind

### TAMING ALLAYS

**Why "Tame":**
- Untamed allays follow indefinitely
- Tamed allays work at note blocks
- Tamed = specialized automation

**Taming Process:**
1. Bring allay to note block
2. Give allay an item type
3. Allay orbits note block
4. Brings items to that note block
5. Now it's stationed there

**Best Allay Uses:**

**Crop Farms:**
- Give allay seeds
- Harvest crops manually
- Allay collects dropped seeds
- Auto-seeds your farm

**Mob Farms:**
- Give allay mob drops (rotten flesh, bones)
- Allay collects drops
- Deposit in chest via hopper
- Automatic sorting

**Storage Rooms:**
- Allay picks up specific items
- Brings to designated note block
- Acts as item filter
- Organizes automatically

**Building Projects:**
- Give allay building material
- Mine/place blocks
- Allay collects drops
- Saves inventory space

### ALLAY BEHAVIOR NOTES

**Follow Range:**
- Teleports if too far (>32 blocks)
- Floats through blocks
- Can't open doors
- Gets stuck in walls sometimes

**Item Collection:**
- Collects only given item type
- Picks up within 16 blocks
- Returns to player or note block
- Stack size limited

**Protection:**
- Allays have 10 HP (5 hearts)
- Can be killed by hostile mobs
- Keep away from danger
- Name tag to prevent despawn

**Crew Talk:**
> "Deploying allay squad to the wheat farm. Three brown, two white. They'll handle the collection pipeline while we work on the mansion expansion."

## 7. CLEARING OPERATIONS - SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

### FLOOR-BY-FLOOR STRATEGY

**FIRST FLOOR PROTOCOL:**
1. Enter, secure entry hall
2. Clear immediate corridors
3. Block off explored areas
4. Work systematically left-to-right
5. Don't advance to second floor until 100% clear

**SECOND FLOOR PROTOCOL:**
1. Use staircase chokepoint
2. Clear rooms clockwise
3. Prioritize allay rooms
4. Watch for evoker clusters
5. Block off cleared sections

**THIRD FLOOR PROTOCOL:**
1. Usually smaller, faster clear
2. Check for secret rooms
3. Loot remaining chests
4. Verify all mobs dead
5. Prepare for extraction

### CORRIDOR CLEARING

**Chokepoint Method:**
- Block corridor with cobble
- Leave 1-block gap
- Shoot bow through gap
- Pick them off safely
- Advance slowly

**Funnel Technique:**
- Open door, back up
- Let them come to you
- Shield + attack in doorway
- They can't surround
- Repeat until room clear

**Staircase Safety:**
- Check above/below before climbing
- Throw snowballs/eggs to trigger mobs
- Shield upward while ascending
- Don't let mobs follow you up
- Block stairs after clearing

### SPAWNER HANDLING

**Common Spawners:**
- Rare in mansions, but possible
- Usually zombies or skeletons
- Check corners of large rooms

**Disabling Protocol:**
1. Light up area (torches)
2. Break spawner with pickaxe
3. Requires 3 minutes to break
4. Silk touch pickaxe = collect spawner
5. Otherwise destroys it

**Spawner Farming (Advanced):**
- Leave spawner intact
- Build killing floor
- Use water streams
- AFK for XP/drops
- Mansion spawners = convenient

### LIGHTING PROTOCOL

**Torch Placement:**
- Every 5 blocks maximum
- Ceiling or wall placement
- Prevents mob spawns
- Marks explored areas
- Don't leave dark corners

**Sign Markings:**
- "CLEAR" = safe, no mobs
- "??" = unexplored
- "DANGER" = evoker present
- "ALLAY" = allay rescued
- Use consistent labeling

### RETREAT AND REGROUP

**When to Pull Back:**
- Health below 30%
- Surrounded by 3+ vindicators
- Multiple evokers in room
- Out of arrows/food
- Crew member down

**Retreat Protocol:**
1. Call retreat clearly
2. Shield up while backing
3. Block corridor with cobble
4. Regroup in cleared area
5. Heal, re-plan, re-engage

## CREW TALK - MANSION OPERATIONS

### Dialogue 1: Pre-Mansion Briefing

**Foreman:** Alright crew, we've located the target. Woodland mansion at coordinates X:4500, Z:-8200. That's a four-hour trek from spawn.

**Scout:** I've been studying the cartographer map. Structure's massive. Vector DB says we're looking at 60+ rooms across three floors.

**Tank:** What's our entry protocol? I don't want to walk into a murder hallway.

**Foreman:** Standard procedure. Scout takes point, peeks windows, reports mob types. Tank follows, shield raised. DPS flanks. Healer watches our six.

**DPS:** Any evoker intel?

**Scout:** Map room shows three evokers based on the layout. That's six totems if we play it right.

**Healer:** Six totems. That's six extra lives distributed across the crew. We go in prepared, we come out rich.

**Foreman:** Exactly. Loadout check: Full iron minimum, diamond preferred. Two stacks arrows each. Potions: Strength, Speed, Regeneration. Golden apples in off-hand.

**Tank:** I've got the shield wall covered. Just don't let me get swarmed. Vindicators in numbers are no joke.

**Foreman:** Nobody goes solo. Nobody plays hero. We clear room by room, floor by floor. Questions?

**All:** None.

**Foreman:** Then saddle up. We've got illagers to evict.

### Dialogue 2: Room Clearing Under Fire

**Scout:** Doorway ahead. I'm picking up multiple hostile signatures. Sounds like... four vindicators, maybe five.

**Tank:** Four or five. I can hold that.

**Foreman:** Hold on, Tank. Let me get a visual. Scout, peek through.

**Scout:** Peeking... I see three vindicators in the main area. Wait, movement in the corner—make that four. That's a conference room. They'll funnel.

**DPS:** Funnel is good. I can thin them from the doorway with my bow.

**Foreman:** Do it. DPS, you're on suppression. Tank, get your shield ready. Once he's taken out two, we rush.

**DPS:** Drawing... First arrow away. Thunk. That's one down.

**Scout:** They're aggroed! They're coming to the door!

**Tank:** Shield UP. Let them come to me.

**DPS:** Second arrow—got another one. Two left.

**Tank:** They're at the doorway. I'm engaging.

**Foreman:** DPS, switch to melee. Flank left. Healer, stay back, watch for adds.

**Tank:** Taking hits but shield's holding. One dead, one to go.

**DPS:** Flanking—CRITICAL HIT. Last one's down.

**Scout:** Room clear. Checking corners... Ceiling's clear. No closets. We're good.

**Foreman:** Good work. Torch it up, block the rear exit. Loot the chests, then we move to the next room.

**Healer:** Tank, you took three hearts of damage. Let me throw a regeneration potion your way.

**Tank:** Appreciate it. Shield's still at 80% durability. I'm good for the next room.

**Foreman:** Stay sharp. We're not even halfway through this floor.

### Dialogue 3: Evoker Encounter

**Scout:** Map room ahead. This is the big one.

**Foreman:** Hold. Let me check my notes... Map room typically spawns two to three evokers. This is prime danger zone.

**DPS:** Evokers. That means totems.

**Healer:** And fangs. And vexes. This room can wipe us if we're careless.

**Tank:** What's the plan? Rush or snipe?

**Foreman:** Snipe first. DPS, bow through the doorway. Thin them out before we enter.

**DPS:** Copy that. Peeking... I see two evokers. One's casting—EVOKER FANGS!

**Tank:** Shield up! Everyone shield up!

**DPS:** Fangs hit the doorframe. They're aware of us. One evoker's summoning vexes!

**Foreman:** We need to rush NOW. Before he gets three vexes out. Tank, lead the charge.

**Tank:** RUSHING! Shield raised, heading straight for the first evoker.

**DPS:** Following Tank. Flanking right.

**Healer:** I'll guard the doorway. Don't let them flank back.

**Tank:** First evoker's casting fangs—shielding through. Almost there—SWING! Got him!

**Scout:** Totem dropped! But the second evoker's summoning—three vexes incoming!

**DPS:** I got the totem! Switching to vexes—they're phasing through the walls!

**Tank:** Ignore the vexes, kill the second evoker! He's the priority!

**Foreman:** DPS, focus the evoker! I'll handle the vexes!

**DPS:** ENGAGING EVOKER—CRITICAL HIT! He's trying to retreat—NO YOU DON'T!

**Healer:** Vexes are swarming! I need help!

**Tank:** Evoker's down. Second totem collected! Switching to vexes—SWORD SWEEP! Two down, one to go!

**DPS:** Last vex is fleeing—it's despawning. Room clear.

**Foreman:** Everyone check your health. That was close.

**Healer:** I'm at half health. Those fangs bypass armor partially.

**Tank:** I'm at eight hearts. Shield absorbed most of it.

**Foreman:** We're alive, we have two totems, and the map room is clear. That's a win. Take two minutes to heal up, then we continue.

**Scout:** Hey, I found a chest in the corner. Diamond blocks.

**Foreman:** Nice. That covers the cost of our potions. Load up, move out.

### Dialogue 4: Allay Rescue

**Scout:** Bedroom ahead. Looking through the window... I see cages. ALLAY CAGES!

**DPS:** How many?

**Scout:** Two cages. Brown allays. They're spinning—definitely alive.

**Foreman:** Allay extraction protocol. Clear the room first, then rescue.

**Tank:** Any mobs in there?

**Scout:** Checking... One vindicator in the corner. Sleeping. We can snipe him before he wakes.

**DPS:** On it. Drawing bow... THUNK. Vindicator's down. Room's clear.

**Foreman:** Good. Tank, you're on rescue. Break the cage, give it an item, get it following you.

**Tank:** Entering room. Approaching first cage... breaking it. Allay's free. Giving it a diamond... it's following me.

**Scout:** Cute little thing. Spinning around like it's happy.

**Foreman:** Get the second one. We don't leave any behind.

**Tank:** Breaking second cage... allay free. Another diamond—now I've got two following me.

**Healer:** We should name them.

**DPS:** Name them? They're allays. We're gonna put them to work on the farm.

**Healer:** Still. First one's Steve. Second one's... Alex.

**Foreman:** Steve and Alex the allays. Fine. Now let's get them back to base safely. If they die, that's two allays we're not getting back.

**Tank:** They're following me through the doorway. Both accounted for.

**Scout:** Where are we deploying them?

**Foreman:** Wheat farm. They'll handle seed collection. We've got bigger things to worry about than manual farming.

**DPS:** Two allays on the farm... that's hours of work we just saved.

**Healer:** Plus they're adorable. Adorability efficiency multiplier.

**Foreman:** If you say so. Let's finish clearing this floor, then we head home. Steve and Alex are coming with us.

### Dialogue 5: Post-Clear Assessment

**Foreman:** Mansion clear. All floors verified. Let's do an assessment.

**Scout:** Sixty-eight rooms cleared. Three evokers killed, eighteen vindicators neutralized. Zero crew casualties.

**DPS:** Loot tally: Four totems of undying, two allays recovered, twelve diamond blocks, three enchanted books, and enough iron to outfit another crew.

**Tank:** We took some hits though. My shield's at 20% durability. Had to use two golden apples.

**Healer:** I went through four regeneration potions. But we're all alive, which is what matters.

**Foreman:** Mission success. Now, what do we do with this place?

**DPS:** We could convert it. This is a prime location. Defensible, massive space, already built.

**Scout:** It's far from spawn though. Four-hour trek. Logistics would be nightmare.

**Tank:** We could use it as an outpost. Forward operating base for this region.

**Healer:** Or we strip it and leave. Take everything valuable, abandon the rest.

**Foreman:** Let's put it to a vote. Convert or strip?

**DPS:** Convert. I'm thinking crew headquarters. We've got the space.

**Scout:** Strip. The location's too inconvenient.

**Tank:** Strip. I don't want to live in an illager building. Creepy.

**Healer:** Convert! We could make it amazing. Plus, the allays like it here.

**Foreman:** Tie vote. Here's my call: We strip the valuables, keep the allays, and leave the rest. The location's too remote for a main base.

**DPS:** But the allays...

**Foreman:** We take the allays with us. They'll follow Tank back to spawn. The mansion's a resource, not a home.

**Scout:** Fair. Let's start stripping. I want every dark oak block, every diamond, everything we can carry.

**Tank:** And then we head home. Four hours back.

**Healer:** With four totems of undying in our pockets. We're basically immortal now.

**Foreman:** Exactly. That's the real prize. Everything else is bonus.

**DPS:** Fine. Strip mode it is. But I'm taking that map room carpet. It's cool.

**Foreman:** If it fits in your inventory, sure. Let's get to work. We've got a mansion to dismantle.

**All:** COPY THAT.

## FINAL NOTES

Woodland mansions are the Overworld's ultimate challenge. They're not just structures—they're fortresses filled with the most aggressive mobs in the game. But the rewards are unmatched.

Four totems of undying means four extra lives for your crew. Allays mean automated resource collection. Diamond blocks mean free enchanting power. The mansion itself, if converted, is an impenetrable base.

But none of that matters if you're dead. Preparation is everything. Don't enter without proper gear. Don't split up. Don't play hero. The mansion will still be there if you need to retreat.

The vector DB's got plenty of mansion run footage. Study the layouts. Learn the evoker patterns. Practice your fang dodging. When you're ready, the mansion will be waiting.

Now get out there and clear those illagers out. That totem ain't gonna collect itself.
