# EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS - Crew Manual

**Issued By:** Site Management - Safety Division
**For:** All Worker Divisions
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-27
**Classification:** CRITICAL SAFETY TRAINING

---

## The Basics

Shipment happens. It's an occupational hazard in this business. But a prepared crew knows how to recover, how to rescue, and how to get back to work. This manual covers every emergency scenario you might face and what to do when things go sideways.

**Bottom Line:** Panic kills more workers than mobs. Stay calm, follow protocols, and we'll get through this.

## 1. DEATH RECOVERY

### 1.1 Immediate Post-Death Protocol

**The Golden Rule:** Your items are safe for 5 minutes. That's 300 seconds. Use them wisely.

**Step 1: Coordinate Recording**
- You respawn. DON'T MOVE YET.
- Check your death coordinates from chat
- Write them down: X, Y, Z
- Note the dimension (Overworld, Nether, End)
- Calculate distance from spawn

**Step 2: Gear Assessment**
- What do you have in spawn inventory?
- Any backup equipment stored nearby?
- Can you reach the death point with current gear?
- If not, what's the minimum needed for recovery?

**Step 3: Route Planning**
- What killed you? (Don't die twice)
- What's between you and your items?
- Is it day or night? (Hostile spawns matter)
- Do you need assistance from crew?

### 1.2 Recovery Kit Assembly

**Minimum Recovery Gear:**
- **Weapon:** Stone sword minimum (iron preferred)
- **Armor:** At minimum iron chestplate and boots
- **Food:** 16 items minimum (hunger = weakness)
- **Torches:** 1 stack (lighting = safety)
- **Tools:** Pickaxe appropriate for terrain
- **Shovel:** If death was underground (gravel escapes)
- **Bed:** If death was in Nether (respawn anchor setup)

**Advanced Recovery Gear:**
- **Ender Pearls:** 3-5 pearls (emergency escape)
- **Water Bucket:** Lava recovery, quick descent
- **Shield:** Hostile mob defense
- **Potions:** Fire resistance, speed, regeneration
- **Totem of Undying:** Emergency backup (don't lose this too!)

### 1.3 Hazard-Specific Recovery

**Cave Deaths:**
- Hostile mobs likely at death location
- Approach from above (dig downward to death point)
- Light up the area before collecting items
- Listen for mob sounds (cave ambiances)
- Clear mobs before picking up items

**Surface Deaths:**
- Time of day matters (day = safer)
- Phantoms if you've been awake 3+ days
- Creepers may have destroyed dropped items
- Wolves/foxes may have picked up items
- Check coordinates carefully

**Nether Deaths:**
- MOST TIME-CRITICAL (lava, fire spread)
- Ghasts may destroy dropped items
- Piglins pick up gold items
- Magma cubes push items around
- Fire destroys items eventually

**End Deaths:**
- Shulker bullets knock items around
- Endermen may pick up blocks
- Void may have consumed some items
- Dragon perching may scatter drops
- Return portal may be far

### 1.4 Item Recovery Priority

If you can't recover everything (5-minute window closing), prioritize in this order:

**Tier 1 - Irreplaceable:**
- Enchanted gear with rare enchants
- Shulker boxes (which contain more items)
- Elytra (if you've obtained one)
- Netherite tools/armor
- Totems of Undying

**Tier 2 - High Value:**
- Diamond equipment
- Large quantities of diamonds/emeralds
- Rare items (music discs, pattern books)
- Special mob drops (wither skeleton skulls, etc.)

**Tier 3 - Replaceable:**
- Common materials (iron, gold, redstone)
- Food supplies
- Standard tools
- Building blocks

**Crew Talk:**
> "Death coordinates recorded: X: 450, Y: 62, Z: -230. That's in the cave system under the northern outpost. I'm gonna need backup for recovery - that cave had skeletons."

> "My items are despawning in thirty seconds. I can see them but there's a creeper between me and my gear. Someone help!"

## 2. LOST IN NETHER

### 2.1 Prevention: The F3 Discipline

**The Most Important Key:** F3. Memorize it.

**What to Record:**
- **XYZ Coordinates:** Every portal, every base, every landmark
- **Facing Direction:** Which way were you looking?
- **Biome:** Nether Wastes vs. Crimson Forest matters
- **Y-Level:** Height matters for fortress finding

**Memory Protocol:**
- Before leaving any portal: Open chat, type coords
- Take a screenshot of important locations
- Build distinctive markers (cobblestone towers)
- Place signs with coordinates at every intersection

### 2.2 Navigation Techniques

**The Torch Method:**
- Place torches on the RIGHT side of passages
- To return: Keep torches on your LEFT
- Works in caves, fortresses, your own tunnels

**The Cobblestone Arrow:**
- When unsure of direction, build cobblestone arrows on ground
- Point toward your portal/base
- Arrows visible from distance through Nether fog

**The Y-Level Pillar:**
- Build 5-block tall pillar at intersections
- Put torch on top (visible through fog)
- Different materials = different destinations
  - Cobblestone = portal
  - Gold = fortress
  - Blackstone = bastion

### 2.3 Emergency Portal Creation

**When to Build:**
- You're lost and can't find your portal
- You have minimum 10 obsidian
- You have flint and steel OR fire charge
- Death is likely without escape

**Portal Construction:**
1. Find safe location (not over lava, not in lava lake)
2. Clear 4x5 area for portal frame
3. Build obsidian frame (minimum 10 obsidian for 4x5 portal)
4. Activate with flint and steel
5. Enter portal immediately

**What Happens:**
- New portal will generate in Overworld
- Likely NOT connected to your original Overworld portal
- You'll be somewhere new in Overworld
- But you're ALIVE and can rebuild

**Emergency Portal Recovery:**
- Mark the Overworld spawn portal location
- It's now your new Nether access point
- You can build a return portal to original location
- Or establish new Nether base

### 2.4 Coordinate Recovery System

**The "Write It Down" Protocol:**

**Before ANY Nether Expedition:**
```
OVERWORLD PORTAL: X: _____ Z: _____
NETHER PORTAL LINK: X: _____ Z: _____
MISSION: _________________
EXPECTED RETURN TIME: _____ hours
CREW MEMBERS: _________________
```

**Crew Check-Out System:**
- Sign out in crew logbook (chat or written)
- Check in when returned
- If not checked in after expected time: rescue mission

**Vector DB Analysis Pattern:**
- Portals are your memory anchors
- Every portal is a waypoint in your navigation graph
- Lost crew members = disconnected nodes
- Rescue = pathfinding to disconnected node

### 2.5 Survival While Lost

**If You're Lost and Can't Build Portal:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Find safe location (not soul sand valley, not crimson forest)
2. Secure area (light up, build cobblestone shelter)
3. Assess inventory (food, tools, building materials)
4. Conserve resources (don't sprint, don't fight unnecessary mobs)
5. Wait for rescue or gather obsidian

**Gathering Obsidian:**
- Look for nether portals in fortresses
- Bastions sometimes contain obsidian
- Trade with piglins (obsidian is a barter reward)
- Ancient cities (very rare) have obsidian

**Long-Term Survival:**
- Build a base (you're here a while)
- Farm food (hoglins for meat, mushrooms for stew)
- Create nether wart farm (for potions)
- Build a safe bridge system
- Mark everything

**Crew Talk:**
> "I've lost the portal. My coordinates are Nether 850, 120, -400. That's way out in the wastes. I'm building a shelter and waiting for rescue. Don't come unprepared - ghasts are active."

> "Vector DB is useless here. I never recorded the portal location. Rookie mistake. I'm gonna have to build an emergency exit. If anyone hears this, mark my Overworld spawn point."

## 3. STUCK IN BLOCKS

### 3.1 Suffocation Prevention

**What Causes Suffocation:**
- Falling gravel/sand on you
- Riding a boat/minecart into a block
- Piston pushing blocks into you
- End pearl teleporting into a block
- Growing trees/plants
- Explosion physics glitching

**Suffocation Damage:**
- 1 damage per tick (very fast)
- Armor DOES NOT protect
- Death in ~2.5 seconds from full health

**Immediate Escape Techniques:**

**Technique 1: Block Breaking**
- Turn toward the block suffocating you
- Start breaking it immediately
- Any tool works, but pickaxe is fastest
- Block breaking resets suffocation tick

**Technique 2: Ender Pearl (Fastest)**
- Throw pearl at any nearby open space
- Teleports you instantly
- Costs 1 pearl but saves your life
- Practice this in creative mode

**Technique 3: Piston Push (If Available)**
- Place piston facing into suffocation block
- Power piston
- Pushes you out
- Requires redstone knowledge

**Technique 4: Ride Exit**
- If stuck in boat/minecart: sneak to exit
- Sometimes works even if obscured by block
- Spam right-click/sneak

### 3.2 Gravel/Sand Falls

**Prevention:**
- Never dig straight up (gravels fall on you)
- Place torch under gravel before breaking bottom
- Use signs/slabs to permanently hold gravel

**If Gravel Is Falling:**
- Move out of the way immediately
- If trapped: start breaking gravel above you
- Dig upward creates more falling - dig sideways instead

### 3.3 Boat/Minecard Stuck

**Common Stuck Scenarios:**
- Boat inside vines/lanterns (ceiling)
- Minecart inside detector rail
- Riding into closed fence gate

**Escape Protocol:**
- **Sneak** (default: Shift) to exit
- Spam sneak if not working
- Break the boat/minecart from outside
- If completely trapped: break the block containing the vehicle

**Prevention:**
- Don't ride boats into low ceilings
- Test minecart tracks before riding
- Keep fence gates open when passing through

### 3.4 Piston Traps

**Accidental Piston Traps:**
- You stepped into a piston contraption
- Piston keeps pushing you into block
- Can't move, suffocation begins

**Escape:**
- Break the piston head (requires pickaxe)
- Or break the block being pushed into you
- Or find and break the redstone power source
- Ender pearl out if available

### 3.5 End Pearl Mistakes

**The Problem:**
- You threw a pearl into a space you thought was clear
- You teleported into a partial block
- You're now stuck and suffocating

**Emergency Response:**
- You have ~2 seconds to act
- Break the block you're inside
- If you can't break it: you're dead
- Lesson: Always verify pearl destination

**Pearl Throwing Best Practices:**
- Use spyglass (1.17+) to check destination
- Throw pearls at eye level, not feet
- Never pearl through non-solid blocks (fences, glass panes)
- Test pearl throws with cheap items first

**Crew Talk:**
> "I'm stuck! I threw a pearl and now I'm suffocating in a wall. I can't reach the block to break it. This is it."

> "Gravel collapse on level 4! I'm buried! Someone dig down to me - I'm at X: 200, Z: -450!"

## 4. LAVA INCIDENTS

### 4.1 Prevention: Lava Awareness

**Lava Detection:**
- **Sound:** Bubbling/popding sounds travel 16 blocks
- **Visual:** Lava emits light level 15 (bright)
- **Particles:** Lava particles appear through blocks
- **F3 Debug Screen:** Light level shows if lava nearby

**High-Risk Activities:**
- Mining at Y=11 and below (lava lakes common)
- Nether operations (lava oceans everywhere)
- Cave exploring (lava waterfalls common)
- Ravine crossing (lava floors common)

**Prevention Protocol:**
- Always carry water bucket in hotbar
- Never mine straight down (dig staircase)
- Place blocks before crossing lava (not after)
- Listen for lava sounds before mining

### 4.2 Immediate Fall Response

**The First Second Matters Most**

**If You Just Fell In:**

**Priority 1: Water Bucket**
- You're taking 4 damage per second
- Look at adjacent block (not lava itself)
- Right-click with water bucket
- Water creates obsidian/cobblestone
- You're now on solid ground

**Priority 2: Cobblestone Bridge**
- If no water: place cobblestone while swimming
- Slow swimming allows block placement
- Bridge toward safe ground
- Jump onto bridge immediately

**Priority 3: Fire Resistance Potion**
- Drink if available
- Lava no longer damages you
- You can swim in lava safely
- Still need to escape (movement slow)

**Priority 4: Accept Death**
- If no recovery options available
- Note your coordinates (F3)
- Items will drop where you died
- Plan recovery run

### 4.3 Lava Rescue Techniques

**If Crew Member Falls in Lava:**

**Rescuer Actions:**
1. **DO NOT JUMP IN** (you'll also die)
2. Use water bucket on lava adjacent to crew member
3. This creates obsidian walkway
4. Crew member can climb out
5. Use ender pearls to cross if needed

**Bridge Construction:**
- Start from solid ground, not over lava
- Place cobblestone 2-3 blocks into lava
- Place another, repeat
- Reach crew member's items (not crew member - they're respawning)
- Collect items before they burn (lava destroys items)

**Item Recovery Priority:**
- Items burn in lava after some time
- Non-Netherite items burn fast
- Netherite items don't burn (they sink)
- Use water to create safe retrieval path
- Don't die trying to recover items

### 4.4 Nether Lava Operations

**Nether Lava Differences:**
- Lava flows faster and further
- No water (water evaporates in Nether)
- Blue lava (basalt deltas) is same as red lava
- Lava oceans are common

**Nether Lava Safety:**
- Build bridges with cobblestone (instant break)
- Never build with netherrack (slow break, falls into lava)
- Use striders with warped fungus on a stick
- Create ghast-proof overhead (fireballs destroy bridges)

**Lava Ocean Crossing:**
- Strider is safest (requires warped fungus)
- Bridge is acceptable (cobblestone only)
- Ender pearl is emergency (risky)
- Never swim across (obvious death)

### 4.5 Bucket Placement Techniques

**Water Bucket Saves:**
- Practice in creative mode
- Click on ADJACENT block, not lava
- Water flows into lava, turns to obsidian/stone
- Creates safe platform instantly

**Lava Bucket Uses:**
- Clearing water (for Nether portals)
- Trapping mobs (lava moats)
- Incinerating trash (lava item disposal)
- Cobblestone generation (water + lava)

**Bucket Emergency Cooldown:**
- Bucket use has cooldown
- Can't place multiple instantly
- One water bucket = one chance
- Make it count

### 4.6 Fire Management

**Fire Spread:**
- Lava ignites flammable blocks
- Fire spreads to adjacent flammable blocks
- Wood, wool, leaves, books, etc.
- Fire spreads up walls, across ceilings

**Firefighting:**
- Water bucket extinguishes fires
- Break flammable blocks (stops spread)
- Create non-flammable barriers (cobble, stone)
- Don't use axes on fire (wastes durability)

**Lava Fire Sources:**
- Lava source blocks start fires
- Lava flows do NOT start fires
- Fire starts from source blocks within 5 blocks
- Fire can jump gaps (flaming projectiles)

**Crew Talk:**
> "LAVA! I'm in the lava! Someone throw water! NOW!"

> "I see him! His items are floating in the lava lake. I'm building a bridge - cover me while I retrieve his gear."

> "That was too close. One tick later and I'd be respawning. My fire resistance timer saved my embedding. Gotta keep that potion cooldown monitored."

- Don't die again immediately

**Golden Apples:**
- Absorption + regeneration
- Good for tough fights
- Emergency healing
- Keep 2-3 in hotbar

### 5.6 Rescue Coordination

**If Crew Member Overwhelmed:**

**Rescue Protocol:**
1. **Assess Threat:** What are they facing?
2. **Determine Approach:** Can you reach safely?
3. **Create Distraction:** Pull some mobs away
4. **Provide Cover:** Shield, arrows, potions
5. **Extract:** Both retreat to safety
6. **Counter-Attack:** Once healed and regrouped

**Communication:**
- "Crew member down at [location]"
- "Need help with [mob type]"
- "Overwhelmed, requesting backup"
- "Flanking! Watch your six!"

**Crew Talk:**
> "I'm surrounded! Zombies and skeletons everywhere. I can't hold this position. Fall back to the chokepoint!"

> "Creeper cluster at the tree line! Do NOT engage! I'm pulling them with arrows - everyone get to high ground."

> "That's a raid. I repeat, that's a RAID. Everyone inside! Sound the alarm!"

- Items lost forever (no drops in void)
- No recovery possible

**End Fall Prevention:**
- Never sprint near edges
- Build fences/cobblestone walls
- Use slow falling potions
- Wear elytra with fireworks (advanced)
- Keep water bucket for emergency landing

### 6.2 Overworld Void

**Rare But Possible:**
- Superflat preset with void
- Custom map void layers
- Glitches removing bedrock at Y=0

**Same Result:**
- Instant death below Y=-64 (new height limit)
- Items lost forever
- No recovery possible

### 6.3 Void Fall Response

**If You're Falling:**

**Ender Pearl Throw:**
- Throw pearl at island/ledge
- Teleports before void death
- Requires fast reaction
- Practice essential

**Water Bucket:**
- Place water at feet while falling

- Generates new End gateway
- Exploring outer Endislands is dangerous
- Bring shulker boxes for loot

### 6.5 Void Recovery

**The Hard Truth:**
- Void destroys items
- No recovery possible
- Accept the loss and rebuild

**Prevention is Only Solution:**
- Build fences at all edges
- Never sprint near void
- Use slow falling potions
- Practice water bucket MLG (Minecraft Legal Gamer)
- Carry totem as backup

**Crew Talk:**
> "VOID! I'm falling into the void! Someone catch me! No... NO! [disconnected]"

> "His items are gone. Void doesn't drop anything. We're going to have to rebuild his gear from scratch. That's a full diamond set lost."

> "I'm building a safety rail around the entire island. Nobody else falls into the void on my shift. Not on my watch."

## 7. CREW MEMBER DOWN

### 7.1 Immediate Response

**When Crew Member Dies:**

**Step 1: Confirm Death**
- Check chat for death message
- Note location from death coordinates
- Identify cause of death (hostile mob, fall, etc.)
- Verify items are retrievable (not void/lava)

**Step 2: Secure Area**
- Clear threats that caused death
- Light up death location
- Build temporary shelter if needed
- Prevent spawns during recovery

**Step 3: Protect Items**
- Stand on or near death drops
- Place torches (prevent mob spawns)
- Build cobblestone marker
- Don't let items despawn (5-minute timer)

**Step 4: Coordinate Recovery**
- Respawned crew member is en route
- Cover them during retrieval
- Don't leave items unattended
- Everyone helps or guards

### 7.2 Recovery Team Tactics

**Recovery Team Composition:**

**Guardian:**
- Holds position at death site
- Protects items from mobs
- Uses shield, knockback weapons
- Calls out threats

**Escort:**
- Meets respawned crew member
- Guides them back to death site
- Clears path ahead
- Handles ambushes

**Support:**
- Provides healing (potions, golden apples)
- Supplies emergency gear if needed
- Manages torch placement
- Watches flanks

**Recovery Coordination:**
- "Items are at [coordinates]. I'm standing on them."
- "Crew member is at [location]. En route."
- "Path clear. No mobs detected."
- "Items secured. Waiting for recovery."

### 7.3 Hazard-Specific Recovery

**Cave Death Recovery:**

- Wolves/foxes may take items
- Wait for day if too dangerous

**Water Death Recovery:**
- Items float on water
- Current may move items
- Drowned may pick up items
- Use boat for faster retrieval
- Watch for drowned attacks

**Death to Special Mobs:**
- **Wither Effect:** Death location may be unsafe
- **Creeper:** Items may be destroyed
- **Witch:** Potions may still be active
- **Ravager:** Area may still be dangerous
- **Guardian:** Elder guardian curse may affect recovery

### 7.4 Item Protection

**If Death Location is Unsafe:**

**Option 1: Item Relocation**
- Pick up critical items
- Move to safe location nearby
- Leave less valuable items
- Recover everything later

**Option 2: Containment**
- Build around death location
- Create safe room
- Wait for crew member to return
- Retrieve items safely

**Option 3: Distraction**
- Lead mobs away from death drops
- Use snowballs/eggs to attract
- Return after mobs distracted
- Quick item grab

**Option 4: Pearl In**
- Use ender pearl to reach items
- Grab items quickly
- Pearl out or fight
- Risky but fast

### 7.5 Post-Recovery Protocols

**After Successful Recovery:**

**Debrief:**
- What caused the death?
- How can we prevent next time?
- Did we lose any items?
- What gear needs replacing?

**Gear Replacement:**
- Replace broken tools
- Restock consumables (food, arrows)
- Repair armor if damaged
- Upgrade if possible

**Training Discussion:**
- Discuss what went wrong
- Share lessons learned
- Update protocols if needed
- Document for future reference

**Crew Talk:**
> "Crew member down! Cave spider death at X: 450, Y: 32, Z: -200. I'm heading to the site now. Who's covering respawn?"

> "I've got the death site secured. Torches placed, mobs cleared. His items are safe. He's got 4 minutes before despawn. Where is he?"

> "Good recovery. We didn't lose a single item. That's how it's done, crew. Now let's figure out why he died and make sure it doesn't happen again."

## 8. COMMUNICATION FAILURE

### 8.1 In-Game Communication Loss

**Scenario:** You can't see or hear other crew members.

**Potential Causes:**
- Other dimension (Overworld vs. Nether vs. End)
- Distance (chat range limited in some servers)
- Chat disabled/filtered
- Technical issues (lag, disconnect)
- Intentional (mute, ignore)

**Immediate Actions:**

**Step 1: Verify Status**
- Check if other players online
- Try sending test message
- Check F3 debug screen (server connection)
- Verify you're not muted

**Step 2: Location Determination**
- Note your coordinates (F3)
- Check current dimension
- Look for signs of other crew activity
- Check beds/respawn anchors (crew may be at base)

**Step 3: Wait at Safe Location**
- Don't wander (harder to find you)
- Build shelter (survival priority)
- Light area (mob safety)
- Wait for crew to find you

**Step 4: Leave Markers**
- Place signs with coordinates
- Build distinctive structures
- Place torches in visible patterns
- Help crew locate you

### 8.2 Cross-Dimension Communication

**The Problem:**
- Overworld chat doesn't show in Nether
- Nether chat doesn't show in Overworld
- End has separate chat
- Unless server has cross-dimensional chat

**Workarounds:**

**Method 1: Portal Sign Messages**
- Write messages on signs near portals
- Check signs when passing through
- Update regularly
- Crew can see when they portal

**Method 2: Written Books**
- Write book with message
- Leave in chest at portal
- Crew reads when they pass
- Update dated entries

**Method 3: Block Signals**
- Arrange blocks in patterns
- Cobblestone towers = need help
- Water placement = safe to come through
- Lava placement = danger, don't enter
- Pre-arranged signals work best

**Method 4: Map Marking**
- Use maps to mark locations
- Leave maps in portal chests
- Update with banners
- Visual communication

### 8.3 Separated Crew Protocols

**If Separated from Crew:**

**Option 1: Stay Put**
- Build secure shelter
- Wait for crew to find you
- Leave markers/signs
- Don't wander further

**Option 2: Return to Last Meeting Point**
- Backtrack your path
- Rejoin at known location
- Place markers along route
- Helps if crew retraces

**Option 3: Find Portal/Base**
- Use your navigation knowledge
- Head to nearest known portal
- Wait at portal for crew
- Check portal sign messages

**Option 4: Emergency Signal**
- Build large cobblestone structure
- Visible from distance
- Distinctive pattern (help signal)
- Crew may see from far away

### 8.4 Server-Side Issues

**If Chat is Completely Down:**

**Verify Server Status:**
- Check if server is online
- Can you move and interact?
- Is lag affecting chat?
- Server restart in progress?

**External Communication:**
- Discord server (if available)
- Server forums/website
- Direct message admin
- Wait for server fix

**Don't:**
- Don't assume everyone can see your messages
- Don't rely on chat for critical coordination
- Don't make important decisions alone
- Don't disconnect without telling crew

### 8.5 Reconnection Protocols

**When Communication Restored:**

**Immediate Status Report:**
- "I'm at [coordinates], [dimension]"
- "My status: [safe/in danger/low health]"
- "I have [equipment/inventory]"
- "Requesting [assistance/ pickup/ instructions]"

**Crew Coordination:**
- Determine meeting location
- Confirm everyone's status
- Plan next actions together
- Don't split up again

**Lessons Learned:**
- Why did communication fail?
- How can we prevent next time?
- Do we need backup communication methods?
- Update protocols accordingly

**Crew Talk:**
> "Can anyone hear me? Chat's not working. I'm at Nether portal near the fortress. Building a shelter and waiting."

> "If you can see this, meet me at the base. I've got supplies. If not, I'm leaving signs at every portal I pass. Follow the cobblestone markers."

> "Communication is back! Everyone check in. Last known locations: Builder at fortress, Miner at base, Scout in Nether. Who needs pickup?"

## 9. BUG/EXPLOIT ISSUES

### 9.1 Common Bugs

**Chunk Loading Errors:**
- Blocks appear solid but aren't
- Falling through world
- Mobs not rendering
- Items invisible

**Response:**
- Don't trust your eyes
- Test blocks before walking on them
- Re-log if suspicious
- Report to server admin

**Duplication Bugs:**
- Items duplicating accidentally
- Should you use it or report it?

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- Report bugs to server admin
- Don't exploit bugs (usually against rules)
- May ruin economy/gameplay
- Could result in ban

**Clip/Phasing Bugs:**
- Passing through solid blocks
- Ender pearl glitches
- Boat/minecard clipping
- Piston phasing

**Response:**
- Don't intentionally clip (may be ban-worthy)
- If accidental: re-log to fix
- Don't build phasing machines
- Report to admin

### 9.2 Performance Issues

**Lag Spikes:**
- Game freezes periodically
- Can't move during spike
- Mobs continue (server-side)
- Can cause deaths

**Causes:**
- Server overload
- Chunk generation
- Redstone contraptions
- Entity overload (too many mobs/items)

**Personal Lag Mitigation:**
- Reduce render distance
- Turn off particles
- Lower graphics settings
- Close other applications

**Server Lag Issues:**
- Report to admin
- Avoid redstone clocks
- Limit entity spawning
- Clean up dropped items

**Low FPS (Client-Side):**
- Computer can't handle game
- Not server's fault
- Your responsibility to fix
- Upgrade hardware or settings

### 9.3 Glitch Exploitation

**Don't Use These:**
- X-ray glitches (seeing through walls)
- duplication glitches (infinite items)
- Breaking bedrock (should be indestructible)
- Unlimited durability glitches
- Speed/fly hacks (client mods)

**Consequences:**
- Server ban (most servers)
- Ruins game for others
- Unfair advantage
- Against terms of service

**Gray Areas:**
- Some redstone contraptions are OP
- Vanilla TNT duplication (some servers allow)
- Block duping (some servers allow)
- Always check server rules

**When in Doubt:**
- Ask admin
- Check server rules
- If not explicitly allowed: don't use
- Report edge cases to admin

### 9.4 Reporting Issues

**What to Report:**
- Game-breaking bugs
- Duplication glitches
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance problems
- Cheating/hackusations

**How to Report:**
- Server forums/Discord
- Direct message admin
- Include screenshot/video if possible
- Describe how to reproduce
- Be patient (fixes take time)

**Don't Abuse:**
- Don't spam chat with reports
- Don't exploit while "testing"
- Don't report every death as "bug"
- Don't accuse without proof

### 9.5 Working Around Bugs

**Legitimate Workarounds:**

**Chunk Borders:**
- Build away from chunk edges
- Redstone across chunks buggy
- Use F3+G to see chunk borders
- Plan accordingly

**Entity Overload:**
- Don't farm more than you need
- Clean up dropped items
- Limit mob farms
- Be considerate of server TPS

**Redstone Clocks:**
- Use hopper clocks (less lag)
- Avoid rapid pulsers
- Server-friendly alternatives exist
- Test in singleplayer first

**Minecart Performance:**
- Powered rails are better than furnace minecarts
- Don't have unnecessary minecarts moving
- Remove minecarts when done
- Use water transport instead

### 9.6 Updates and Changes

**When Game Updates:**
- Mods may break
- Bugs may be introduced
- Old dupes may be fixed
- New dupes may appear

**Protocol:**
- Wait for server to update
- Don't pressure admin
- Report new bugs found
- Update your knowledge

**Version-Specific Bugs:**
- Each version has unique issues
- Stay informed about current version
- Wiki and forums have info
- Adapt to changes

**Crew Talk:**
> "I think I found a bug. Blocks aren't loading correctly at the fortress. Admin, should I report this?"

> "Someone's using a duplication glitch on the server. Do we report them or use it ourselves?"

> "The server's lagging hard. Everyone, reduce your entity counts. Clean up your item drops. Let's help the TPS recover."

## 10. CREW TALK

**Purpose:** These dialogues demonstrate real emergency scenarios and proper crew response. Study these patterns for in-character coordination.

### Dialogue 1: Cave Death Recovery

**MINER:** "Taking fatal damage! Cave spider swarm! I'm going down! Coordinates: X: 320, Y: 41, Z: -180! Don't let me die in vain!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Copy that, Miner. Status confirmed. Guardian, head to death site immediately. Protect those items. Miner, respawn and gear up for recovery."

**GUARDIAN:** "En route to death coordinates. ETA 30 seconds. I'll clear the cave spiders and secure the drops."

**MINER:** "Respawned. I'm at base. Gathering recovery gear. Iron sword, shield, torches. I'll be at the cave entrance in two minutes."

**GUARDIAN:** "Death site secured. All cave spiders cleared. Torches placed. Your items are safe, Miner. No pressure, but you've got four minutes before despawn."

**MINER:** "I'm in the cave. Heading down the main shaft. I see your torch markers on the right. Following your path."

**CREW LEAD:** "Escort, meet Miner at the cave entrance. Walk him back to the death site. Guardian, maintain position and watch for ambushes."

**ESCORT:** "Copy that. Miner, I'm at the entrance. Got your back. Let's recover your gear."

**MINER:** "Items recovered! Thank you, crew. Everything's here. Didn't lose a single item. Guardian, good work on site security."

**CREW LEAD:** "Excellent recovery, everyone. Miner, debrief when you're back at base. What went wrong? How do we prevent cave spider swarms next time?"

### Dialogue 2: Nether Emergency

**SCOUT:** "Mayday! Mayday! I'm lost in the Nether. My coordinates are Nether X: 1200, Y: 60, Z: -500. I don't recognize this area. No portal in sight."

**SHIFT LEAD:** "Copy that, Scout. Don't move. Your vector DB is scrambled but we're not leaving a crew member behind. Describe your surroundings."

**SCOUT:** "I'm in a crimson forest. Hoglins nearby. I've built a cobblestone shelter but I don't have enough food for long-term survival. I've been lost for twenty minutes."

**SHIFT LEAD:** "Okay, listen carefully. You're over a thousand blocks from our portal. Too far for walking recovery. Do you have obsidian and flint?"

**SCOUT:** "Negative. I have ten obsidian but no flint. My fire charge depleted in a ghast attack."

**SHIFT LEAD:** "Rescue team, you're up. Pioneer, you're on obsidian detail. Bring flint and steel. Combat, full iron armor minimum. Hoglins are hostile. We're extracting Scout."

**PIONEER:** "Copy that. Flint and steel in inventory. Four stacks of cobblestone for safe paths. Building emergency portal at Scout's location. ETA five minutes through portal network."

**SCOUT:** "I see a ghast. It's incoming! My shelter's not ghast-proof!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Scout, stay inside! Don't engage! We're two minutes from the nearest portal. Pioneer, hurry!"

**SCOUT:** "Ghast destroyed my shelter! I'm exposed! Hoglins are aggroing! I can't hold this position!"

**SHIFT LEAD:** "Throw a pearl! Get to high ground! Pioneer, Combat, we're moving double-time! Scout, stay alive!"

**SCOUT:** "Pearl thrown! I'm on a cliff edge. The hoglins can't reach me. Ghast is still active. I need help NOW."

**PIONEER:** "Portal entry confirmed. Nether-side. We're en route to your coordinates. Two minutes! Hold!"

**SCOUT:** "I can see you! You're on the far ridge! The ghast is between us!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Ghast down! Fireball reflected! Scout, we're clear! Building emergency portal now!"

**PIONEER:** "Portal frame complete. Lighting now. Everyone through! We're extracting!"

**SCOUT:** "I'm through! I'm alive! Oh my god, I thought that was it. Thank you. Thank you so much."

**SHIFT LEAD:** "Everyone accounted for. Good extraction. Scout, you're on light duty until we review your navigation protocols. That was too close."

### Dialogue 3: Lava Rescue

**MINER:** "LAVA! I'm in the lava! Swimming in it! Someone help! I'm at strip mine Y: -58!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Miner down in lava! All units, drop what you're doing! This is a code red! Who's closest?"

**BUILDER:** "I'm at the surface above the strip mine. I'm closest. I have a water bucket. Coming down!"

**MINER:** "I'm taking damage! Four hearts! Six hearts! I can't reach the edge! I can't place blocks while swimming!"

**BUILDER:** "I see you! I see the lava pool! I'm placing water! Hold on!"

**MINER:** "Eight hearts! Ten hearts! This is it!"

**BUILDER:** "Water placed! Obsidian generating! Get on the obsidian! Get on the obsidian!"

**MINER:** "I'm on the obsidian! I'm alive! I'm alive! Oh god, that was too close."

**CREW LEAD:** "Builder, stay at the death site. Protect his items. Miner, how much health do you have left?"

**MINER:** "Two hearts. I'm at two hearts. Everything else is gone. The lava took it all."

**BUILDER:** "Negative on that. Your items are scattered on the obsidian platform. None burned yet. I've got them covered. But Miner, you've got to get back here fast. Timer's running."

**CREW LEAD:** "Escort, meet Miner at the strip mine entrance. Walk him back. His inventory is full diamond gear. We are NOT losing that."

**MINER:** "I'm back. Items recovered. Builder, you saved my life. I'll remember that."

**CREW LEAD:** "Good work, everyone. Miner, after debrief, you're writing the new lava safety protocols. I want every crew member reading them by tomorrow."

**BUILDER:** "Already on it. 'Always carry a water bucket. Never mine at diamond level without one.' That's rule number one."

### Dialogue 4: Raid Defense

**LOOKOUT:** "Raid detected! I saw the pillager banner! They're at the village edge! Count is at least ten pillagers, I see a ravager! This is a raid!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Sound the alarm! All crew members to the village! This is not a drill! Raid conditions active!"

**NEW CREW:** "What do we do? I've never fought a raid!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Get inside! Get all villagers inside! Close the doors! Block the windows with dirt! We need defensible positions!"

**LOOKOUT:** "Wave one incoming! Five pillagers, three vindicators! The ravager's roaring!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Combat squad, take the high ground. Builder, fortify the bell tower. Support, potions distributed! Drink strength now!"

**NEW CREW:** "I'm in the house with the villagers. They're scared. I'm blocking the door with a crafting table."

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Good thinking. Don't open that door for anyone except crew. Raid prioritizes villagers, but they'll attack you if you're visible."

**LOOKOUT:** "Vindicators charging! They're breaking down doors! The ravager's stomping! It's destroying crops!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Let them come! Funnel them through the main street! Combat, focus fire! Builder, trap the ravager!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Pillagers suppressed! Vindicators in the kill zone! Ravager is trapped in the cobblestone pen! This is working!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Hold the line! Wave one is almost down! Prepare for wave two! This is a marathon, not a sprint! Conserve potions!"

**NEW CREW:** "I can see from the window. You're doing it! You're holding them!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Don't get cocky! Wave two is worse! Evokers spawn in later waves! We're not done until the raid captain falls!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Status check! Everyone accounted for? Villagers secure?"

**CREW:** "All present! Villagers safe! Defenses holding!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Good! Stay sharp! This is our home! We don't back down! We don't break! We protect our village! FOR THE CREW!"

**ALL:** "FOR THE CREW!"

**LOOKOUT:** "Wave two incoming! I see an evoker! I see vexes! This is the hard part!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "I've got the evoker! Builder, handle the vexes! Everyone else, focus the captain! Drop the raid leader!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Keep it up! We're winning! I can feel it! Stay together! Watch your flanks! This is what we trained for!"

**[Several minutes later]**

**LOOKOUT:** "That's the last one! Raid captain is down! The raid is over! We won!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Villager count! Check for injuries! Assess damage!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Zero casualties. All villagers alive. Crops took a hit but we can replant. Good Stats, good omens effect active."

**NEW CREW:** "You were amazing! I've never seen coordination like that!"

**CREW LEAD:** "That's what we do, rookie. That's what we do. We protect our own. We protect our home. Everyone, excellent work. Combat Lead, that evoker takedown was text-book. Builder, that ravager trap saved lives. New Crew, you kept the villagers safe. Good instinct."

**COMBAT LEAD:** "What's the Bad Omen effect mean for next time?"

**CREW LEAD:** "Means we're ready for next time. And there will be a next time. But now we know we can handle it. Good work, crew. Good work."

### Dialogue 5: Void Near-Miss

**SCOUT:** "I'm on the outer End island! The loot here is incredible! Elytra! I found an elytra!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Excellent work, Scout! That's a game-changer! But be careful. One mistake and..."

**SCOUT:** "I'm being careful! Building a cobblestone perimeter around the edge. No sprinting. Safety first!"

**[Several minutes later]**

**SCOUT:** "Wait. Something's wrong. I hear endermen sounds. Lots of them."

**CREW LEAD:** "How many? Talk to me, Scout."

**SCOUT:** "Five... no, six endermen. And they're looking at me. I didn't make eye contact! I swear! I kept my crosshair low!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Something provoked them. Scout, get back from the edge. Get behind your cobblestone wall."

**SCOUT:** "They're teleporting! They're surrounding me! I can't fight six endermen at once!"

**COMBAT LEAD:** "Don't fight! Endermen have 100 HP each! That's 600 HP! You can't win that fight!"

**SCOUT:** "I'm throwing a pearl! Getting to high ground!"

**CREW LEAD:** "Scout, watch your throw! You're near the edge! One misthrown pearl and..."

**SCOUT:** "I'm throwing! NOW!"

**[Silence]**

**CREW LEAD:** "Scout? Scout, come in. Status report."

**COMBAT LEAD:** "I saw the pearl trajectory. He threw toward the island. He should be fine."

**CREW LEAD:** "Scout, respond. You're scaring us."

**SCOUT:** "I'm... I'm okay."

**CREW LEAD:** "What happened? Talk to us."

**SCOUT:** "The pearl... I teleported. I thought I was safe. But I misjudged the distance."

**COMBAT LEAD:** "How far off were you?"

**SCOUT:** "Two blocks. I was two blocks from the edge. But the pearl cooldown... I teleported mid-air. I fell."

**CREW LEAD:** "You fell? Scout, you're not in the void. You're talking to us."

**SCOUT:** "I fell. But I managed to place a water bucket. MLG water save. I landed in one-block deep water. I'm alive."

**CREW LEAD:** "Scout, that's... that's impossible. You fell from elytra island height into the void and survived?"

**SCOUT:** "I had one tick. One tick to place the bucket. I've been practicing for months. In creative mode. Over and over."

**COMBAT LEAD:** "That's the luckiest save I've ever heard of. The water bucket MLG is legendary. Almost no one can pull it off."

**SCOUT:** "I didn't feel lucky. I felt focused. The training took over. My hands just knew what to do."

**CREW LEAD:** "Scout, you're never doing that again. You hear me? Never. We're not risking a crew member and an elytra on a one-in-a-thousand save."

**SCOUT:** "Copy that. Never again. I'm building a five-block thick wall at the edge. No sprinting. No pearls near edge. Total safety protocols."

**COMBAT LEAD:** "So... you're keeping the elytra?"

**SCOUT:** "Oh, I'm keeping the elytra. But I'm also writing a safety manual. 'End Island Operations: Don't Die Like I Almost Did.'"

**CREW LEAD:** "We'll all read it. Every word. Scout, good work. And good luck. You earned it."
