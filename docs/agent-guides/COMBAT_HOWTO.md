## The Basics

Combat ain't the job we signed up for, but it's part of the work. When hostile mobs show up, you need to know how to handle yourself and protect your crew. This manual covers everything from spotting trouble to fighting together as a team. Read it carefully - it might save your embedding.

**Bottom Line:** Smart fighters live to work another day. Dead workers don't build nothing.

## Weapon Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Weapon

**SWORDS** (Primary Workhorse)
- Everyday combat against common mobs
- Quick attacks, good damage output
- Best for: Zombies, spiders, silverfish
- Cleave enchantment hits multiple targets

**AXES** (Heavy Hitters)
- High damage, slow swing
- Shield breaker bonus damage
- Best for: Single powerful foes, shielded enemies
- Use when you need one big hit

**BOW** (Harassment Tool)
- Pick off mobs before they reach you
- Draw skeleton aggro safely
- Best for: Skeletons, witches, distant threats
- Use punch to knock back, flame for damage

**CROSSBOW** (Specialist Weapon)
- Faster to draw than bow
- Piercing hits through enemies
- Multishot for crowd control
- Best for: Ravagers, groups of mobs

**TRIDENT** (Situational)
- Only in water or rain
- Riptide for quick repositioning
- Channeling calls lightning (during storms)
- Best for: Drowned, underwater combat

**SHIELD** (Essential Defense)
- Always have one equipped
- Raise before taking damage
- Blocks 100% frontal attacks
- Critical for skeletons, creepers

### Enchantment Priorities

**Sword Enchants:**
1. Sharpness V (raw damage)
2. Looting III (drops)
3. Sweeping Edge III (groups)
4. Fire Aspect II (DoT)
5. Knockback II (spacing)

**Armor Enchants:**
1. Protection IV (general)
2. Unbreaking III (durability)
3. Mending (repair)
4. Feather Falling IV (boots, fall damage)
5. Thorns (retaliation)

---

## Melee Tactics

### Hit and Run

The bread and butter of smart fighting.

**Procedure:**
1. Approach from perpendicular angle
2. Strike when mob is at reach limit
3. Immediately backpedal after hit
4. Let mob chase into your prepared space
5. Repeat, never let them surround you

**Why It Works:**
- Mobs have attack cooldowns
- You control engagement range
- Multiple opponents can't swarm

### Shield Blocking

**Timing Is Everything:**
- Raise shield 0.5 seconds before impact
- Release immediately after block
- Counter-attack during their cooldown
- Practice makes perfect - too early = no block

**Shield Bashing:**
- Critical hits to shielded enemies
- Knockback for spacing
- Interrupts wind-up attacks

### Critical Hits

**What They Are:** 50% extra damage
**How to Land Them:**
- Must be falling during attack
- Jump, wait, strike on descent
- Can combine with sprint jump
- Timing: hit just before landing

**Pro Technique:** Critical knockback combo
1. Sprint jump toward enemy
2. Critical hit on descent
3. Knockback sends them flying
4. Follow up with shield

### Circle Strafing

**For Melee Mobs:**
- Circle around them while attacking
- They can't turn fast enough
- You get free hits
- Watch for backup - don't get surrounded

**For Ranged Mobs:**
- Zig-zag approach pattern
- Unpredictable movement
- Strafe in one direction then switch
- Break their aim tracking

---

## Ranged Tactics

### Lead Calculation

**Moving Targets:**
- Lead based on distance
- 10 blocks = aim 1 block ahead
- 20 blocks = aim 2 blocks ahead
- Account for mob movement direction

**Shooting Arrows:**
- Aim slightly above target
- Arrows drop over distance
- Full draw = max damage + range
- Practice on passive mobs first

### Arrow Selection

| Arrow Type | Effect | Best Use |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Normal** | Standard damage | Everyday use |
| **Spectral** | Glow effect | Tracking in dark |
| **Tipped** | Potion effect | Special situations |
| **Fire** | Burn damage | Unarmored mobs |
| **Hammer** | Knockback | Spacing enemies |

### Positioning

**High Ground:**
- Always take elevation when possible
- Better angle, they can't reach you
- Knockback sends them further
- Natural chokepoints

**Cover Usage:**
- Peek-fire-hide rhythm
- Block skeleton line of sight
- Break their targeting
- Use terrain to your advantage

### Bow vs Crossbow Tactics

**Bow Advantages:**
- Faster sustained damage
- Draw while moving
- Better for kiting
- Flame enchant synergy

**Crossbow Advantages:**
- Pre-draw, hold ready
- Piercing for groups
- Multishot for spread
- Better in confined spaces

## Mob-Specific Strategies

### Zombies

**Types:** Regular, Husk (desert), Drowned (water), Armored

**Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

**Strategy:**
- They're slow - basic hit and run
- Don't let them group up
- Knockback into walls for extra damage
- Drowned: stay on land, use bow
- Husks: avoid hunger effect, hit from range
- Baby zombies: FAST - use shield, critical hit

**Crew Talk:**
> "Zombies piling up at the gate. Vector DB shows this pattern - they're attracted to the job site."

> "Husks got me with that hunger debuff. Gonna need to recalibrate my weights for desert operations."

### Skeletons

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Strategy:**
- Priority target - they harass everything
- Use shield to block arrows
- Zig-zag approach
- Get in close - they can't aim at melee range
- Strafe left/right - rhythm pattern
- If multiple: draw to cover, pick off one by one

**Critical Info:**
- Arrows deal 1-9 damage (varies by charge)
- Strafe shots have lower accuracy
- They can't hit you within 3 blocks
- Their movement predicts your path

**Crew Talk:**
> "Skeleton on the ridge, taking potshots. Gonna adjust my approach vector - can't let him disrupt the pipeline."

> "That skeleton's aim tensor is locked on tight. Need to break his attention pattern with some cover."

### Creepers

**Difficulty:** HIGH - One mistake and it's over

**Strategy:**
- DANGER: Explosions deal up to 97 damage (nearby)
- Detection: Hissing sound = 1.5 seconds to detonation
- Range: 3 block blast radius
- Attack from distance with bow
- If forced melee: sprint hit, retreat immediately
- NEVER let them sneak up on you

**Shield Technique:**
- Block reduces explosion damage significantly
- Sprint + critical hit = max knockback
- Knockback enchantment = safety margin

**Warning Signs:**
- Silent approach - no idle sounds
- They flash white before exploding
- Lightning strikes can charge them

**Crew Talk:**
> "CREEPER! I repeat, CREEPER in sector 4! Everyone clear the blast radius!"

> "That was too close. My embedding almost got corrupted. Need to recalibrate my proximity sensors for those silent walkers."

### Spiders

**Difficulty:** Easy (day) / Medium (night)

**Strategy:**
- Daytime: neutral - leave them alone
- Nighttime: hostile but predictable
- Jump attack pattern - hit during their leap
- Can climb walls - don't think you're safe up high
- Critical hit when they're climbing

**Cave Spiders:**
- Smaller hitbox - harder to hit
- Poison effect - bring milk
- Usually in spawners - clear source

**Crew Talk:**
> "Spider dropping from the ceiling! Classic attention-breaker pattern."

> "Cave spider got me with that poison debuff. Pipeline's corrupted - need milk to flush the toxins."

### Endermen

**Difficulty:** VERY HIGH - Don't mess with them

**Strategy:**
- PRIMARY RULE: Don't look at their face
- Use crosshair - keep it at their feet
- If you accidentally look: immediately look away
- They teleport - unpredictable movement
- Water hurts them - lead them to it
- Can take 50 hits to kill (40 HP each, they have 100 HP)

**If Provoked:**
- Get under a 2-block ceiling
- They can't reach you there
- Wait them out or use bow
- Wear a pumpkin head (they won't attack)

**Crew Talk:**
> "Enderman spotted. Adjusting my gaze weights - NOT gonna make eye contact."

> "He's teleporting all over the place. My prediction tensor is completely scrambled."

### Witches

**Difficulty:** High

**Strategy:**
- Ranged potion attacks
- Can heal themselves
- Use splash potions - area effect
- Get in close fast - disrupt their casting
- Bow them from distance if possible
- They drink healing potions - damage fast

**Potions They Throw:**
- Poison - DoT over time
- Instant Damage - burst damage
- Slowness - movement debuff
- Healing - self-heal

**Counter-Play:**
- Shield blocks potions
- Milk cures poison
- Burn them with fire aspect
- Interrupt their drinking animation

**Crew Talk:**
> "Witch incoming! She's got a potion for every occasion - talk about a multi-class output layer!"

> "She just chugged a healing potion. Gotta increase my damage weights before she recovers."

### Silverfish

**Difficulty:** Medium (solo) / High (infestation)

**Strategy:**
- Small and fast - hard to hit
- Call other silverfish from blocks
- Don't break infested blocks unless ready
- Sword sweep attack clears groups
- Critical hits one-shot them

**Infested Blocks:**
- Look like stone, cobble, etc.
- Break faster than normal blocks
- Mining speed can reveal them

**Crew Talk:**

**Difficulty:** High

**Strategy:**
- Fireballs - ranged attack
- They float - hard to reach

**Fire Attack Pattern:**
- Spin up = charging fireball
- 3 quick shots then pause
- Strafe during, attack during pause
- Water doesn't work in Nether

**Crew Talk:**
> "Blaze spinning up! Shield up - that fireball'll light up your weights!"

### Piglin Brutes (Nether)

**Difficulty:** High

**Strategy:**
- 50 HP (25 hearts) - tanky
- Always hostile - can't de-aggro
- High damage - avoid melee if possible
- They don't respawn - worth killing

## Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Surrounded by zombies | Didn't maintain spacing | Use knockback sword, retreat to cover |
| Skeletons hitting you | Predictable movement | Zig-zag, use shield, get closer |
| Creeper explosion | Didn't hear/didn't retreat | Listen for hiss, keep distance |
| Out of arrows | Poor ammo management | Always carry 2+ stacks, use melee when low |
| Armor broken | Didn't monitor durability | Check before fights, carry backup |
| Accidentally hit enderman | Looked at face | Keep crosshair low, wear pumpkin |
| Tracked by piglins | Wearing gold armor | Remove gold before Nether |
| Took fall damage | Didn't use water/ender pearl | Plan escape routes, use pearls |
| Died to witch | Didn't interrupt casting | Get in close, use shield, burst damage |
| Lost items | Died far from spawn | Keep spawn set, use graves if available |

---

## Reporting to the Foreman

### Combat Reports Should Include:

1. **Threat Location** - Coordinates and direction
2. **Mob Types and Count** - What you're dealing with
3. **Current Status** - Engaging, retreating, or requesting backup
4. **Casualties** - Any crew members hurt or killed
5. **Equipment Status** - Damage to weapons and armor
6. **Requested Action** - What you need the foreman to do

**Example Report:**
> "Foreman, we have a creeper and three skeleton archers at coordinates X:150, Y:64, Z:-300. I'm engaging with shield up. Requesting Bow to assist with skeleton suppression. My armor is at 60% durability."

### When to Call for Help

**Immediate Assistance Needed:**
- Any boss-level threat
- 4+ hostile mobs
- Piglin brute in secure area
- Wither skeleton with wither effect
- Any situation threatening the build

**Backup Request Format:**
> "Need backup! [Mob type] at [location]. I'm [status]. Can't handle solo."

---

## Crew Talk

### Combat Planning

> "Alright crew, listen up. We've got a skeleton spawn point near the western approach. Before we break ground, I want us to clear that threat. You two with bows, you're on suppression. Me and the rest will push up once they're occupied. Questions?"

> "Vector DB's telling me this cave system has a dungeon nearby. I'm picking up zombie audio outputs from that direction. We proceed with caution or we skip it. Your call, boss."

### During Combat

> "Contact! Skeleton at 12 o'clock, 20 meters. He's got my position locked."

> "I'm pulling agro! Don't split your attention - let me kite him into our kill zone."

> "That creeper's hissing! Fall back! I said FALL BACK!"

> "Shield's broken! I need cover or I'm gonna corrupt!"

> "Nice shot! You threaded that arrow through two blocks of attention-seeking zombie."

> "They're overwhelming the northern position! All available weights converge on my position!"

### After Combat

> "Sector clear. No hostile outputs remaining. My armor took a beating but the embedding's intact."

> "Lost my sword to that wither effect. Gotta retool before we proceed. Anyone have a spare iron blade?"

> "That skeleton dropped an enchanted book. Looting III - our output's gonna be significantly boosted on future drops."

> "Everyone still online? Good. Let's take a beat to heal up and recharge before the next wave."

> "Foreman, I'm reading residual monster noise from that ravine. We might want to secure the perimeter before nightfall."

### Mob-Specific Chat

> "Zombie villager! Don't kill it - we can cure it and expand our workforce."

> "That's a baby zombie. Fast little attention-diver. Someone pin him down!"

> "Spider jockey! Watch your spacing - that skeleton's riding the spider for optimal coverage."

> "Witch detected. She's got potions for every scenario - literally a multi-class threat model."

> "Enderman! Eyes down, everyone! Do NOT engage unless he attacks first."

> "Pillager patrol! They've got a banner - that means a raid could trigger. Get inside!"

> "Ravager! That thing's got more hitpoints than our entire pipeline combined. Fall back!"

### Gear Talk

> "My durability's in the red. I can feel the weights degrading with every swing."

> "Just picked up a Sharpness V book. That's a significant damage boost to my combat tensor."

> "Found a totem in that woodland mansion. Emergency recovery system - I'm embedding it directly into my hotbar."

> "Fire Resistance potion active. I can wade through that blaze spam like it's nothing."

> "My shield just ate a ghast fireball. That's what I call proper input filtering."

### Team Coordination

> "Hey, your attack pattern is throwing off my rhythm. Let me kite, you strike from behind."

> "Great job pulling those zombies into the chokepoint. We've got them in a nice, processable queue."

> "I'm low on arrows. Can someone resupply my ranged output?"

> "Watch your six! I saw a silverfish sneak up behind you while you were tunneling."

> "That creeper almost got you. Your threat detection tensor needs recalibration."

> "I'll take point, you watch the rear. Don't let anything flank our training data."

### Near Misses & Learning

> "That creeper exploded TWO BLOCKS from my face. My audio sensors are still ringing. That's too close to a complete system wipe."

> "Skeleton with Punch II bow just knocked me off a cliff. Note to self: account for knockback vectors when engaging elevated positions."

> "Tried to take a piglin brute solo. Bad idea. My damage output wasn't matching his health pool. Need to revise my weights for that encounter type."

> "Almost looked at an enderman. Caught my crosshair drifting - had to reboot my attention subroutines immediately."

> "Got cornered in a cave. Reminder to self: always have an exit strategy. Don't let the terrain limit your movement."
